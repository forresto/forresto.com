<p>Ya, I'm always sceptical when anybody gets obsessive about about a song / album / film... but... you really gotta see <em>Step Into Liquid</em>, and make it a priority.  They really show eveything, from the dinkiest ripples to the biggest <em>possible</em> in this timeframe, from the dinkiest people to the top of the pros.  I'm going to make a houseparty for Tohoku-Iwate surfer dudes and dudettes to watch it, and try to translate it a little as it goes, since it has not come out here yet.  <!-- If you have <a href="ed2k://|file|Step.Into.Liquid.LIMITED.DVDSCR.XviD-DMT.avi|731222016|7E091E690C09069BA3A9B0C6BCB953E9|/">eMule or Donkey, then do that,,,</a>-->... otherwise rent it,,, put it on repeat.  Yes it is cheezy at times, but that is what workoflove-docu is all about, and the cine &amp; muziq/skore make up for it 100x,,, soo much inner-wave scenery....  I'm serious.  And a little yotta.</p>
