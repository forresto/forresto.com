<em>The whole object of travel is not to set foot on a foreign land; it is<br />
at last to set foot on one's own country as a foreign land.</em> - G. K. Chesterton</p>
<p><em>Often I feel I go to some distant region of the world to be reminded<br />
of who I really am.</em> - Michael Crichton</p>
<p>(Of course, we also wanted to check on Forrest to find out if he really<br />
is doing fine as he routinely claims in telephone conversations.)</p></div>
<p>Summary of trip:<br />
Getting there: The longest day of my life: Get up in Atlanta with the<br />
sun at 6:00 AM and watch the sun set in Tokyo at about 7:00 PM. The<br />
trick is that this is 26 hours later. We still have a few hours on<br />
trains before we meet Forrest.<br />
Getting home is worse, because this is the shortest night of my life.<br />
Somehow my body prefers the extra long day to the too short night.</p>
<p>Three days going to three different schools. We were the lesson for<br />
the day. "Visit by American family" We asked and answered hundreds of<br />
questions. (Do you like miso soup?) This was great fun for all of us.</p>

So, how is Forrest doing? Living in a nice little house in sight of<br />
the Pacific Ocean. Surfing, baking bread, discovering all of the local<br />
food and places to visit. Good relationships with coworkers. Loved by<br />
students. Lots of friends, both local and English speakers.<br />
He is a great driver, in my opinion, but is having a little trouble<br />
convincing the Japanese authorities of that. Seems you can drive for<br />
one year using your foreign license, but then must past a very<br />
difficult driving test in order to be licensed for future years.</p>
<p>How are things different in Japan?<br />
<br />People are nice to each other and extremely nice to us. When the<br />
ticket agent at the Narita Airport who was issuing our rail pass and<br />
making seat reservations for us realized that we had only 3 minutes to<br />
catch the train we needed in order to make the connection to get on<br />
the last bullet train for the day she stood up, told us to follow, and<br />
ran to hold the train for us. We didn't know anyone could run that<br />
fast in high heels.</p>

Life is lived close to the floor. Sleeping on futons and eating meals<br />
while sitting on the floor is routine. (Next time I will practice in<br />
advance.)</p>
<p>You really do not wear your outdoor shoes inside.</p>
<p>Lots of rice and fish. Gardens in every possible place.<br />
Tiny cars. Clothes dried outdoors.</p>
<p>Based on my observation at the three schools in Japan that I visited<br />
it is clear that we have omitted a few things from the Mountain<br />
Community School plans:

A place to store shoes near the front door where you remove your outdoor shoes and put on your indoor shoes.</li>
<li>Sinks in the hall for tooth brushing after lunch.</li>
<li>An art room, music room, International Understanding Classroom, computer room, gymnasium, lunch room, auditorium, swimming pool, and tennis courts. Nurses room.</li>
</ul>

Not sure why they had a lunchroom as the meals were served by students<br />
in the classrooms.</p>
<p>Also, the schools are cleaned by the students after classes.</p>
<p>At one school we participated in the annual cleaning of the swimming pool.<br />
This was a cooperative event where every student and staff member<br />
scrubbed and cleaned the pool to prepare for filling. This was<br />
accomplished in one hour with not a bit of instruction required nor a<br />
single complaint registered.</p>
