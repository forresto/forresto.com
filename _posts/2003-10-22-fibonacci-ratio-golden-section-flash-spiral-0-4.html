<p><a title="fibonacci_0_4.swf (1.66KB)" href="http://folktunes.org/forresto/galleries/flashFibonacci/fibonacci_0_4.swf"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/fibonacci_0_4.thumb.png" align="left" class="picture" /></a>I have always wanted to write a program to <a title="fibonacci_0_4.swf (1.66KB)" href="http://folktunes.org/forresto/galleries/flashFibonacci/fibonacci_0_4.swf">draw a Fibonacci Spiral</a>, and today I finally succeeded. Flash does not make it straightforward to to draw circular sections, so the curves are a little squashed, but get they get the point across. Flash chokes when the movie clips get huge, so for now I have it set up to reset itself before that. The funkiest part was to get it to resize and recenter every time. If you want to check out the code that does most the gruntwork <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/forrestino/79271.html">shoot yourself</a>.</p>
