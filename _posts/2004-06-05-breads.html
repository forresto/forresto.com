<p>Ok, no weaver street bread secrets yet; so y'all are useless.  I just saw two ants walk straight into each other... *bonk* (or better onomatopoeia). I got 5kilos of whole wheat flour from tengu, so i'm gonna set some of <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100301145023/http://home.att.net/~carlsfriends/OTbrochure.html">carl's</a> sourdough yeasties out for proofing tonight. Peanut shells for mulch. Surfing in the morning makes me feel like i'm bobbing up and down all day. I learned how to make nan, which is indian flat bread, which i've only ever had in japan. It makes a good tortilla substitute; i'd forgotten how good salsa and yogurt are together. I used green kinako in the dough, so my nan is green. I'm also going to make some sourdough pancake batter tonight for eating tomorrow morning after the ocean. Surfing and sourdough pancakes, what could be better? My family is coming in the evening, that's what.</p>
