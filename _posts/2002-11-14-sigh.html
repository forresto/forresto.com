<p>as<br />
planned, the thesis is now rendering. whew. i didn't think about it until<br />
today, but suddenly all of my tuesdays and thursdays are going to be stress-<br />
and class-free. i have gotten quite sick of this project, so I won't be too<br />
dismayed when it is all done. i'm sad about being sick of it, because it<br />
is my creation... basically i wish i had designed the project a little differently.<br />
but hey, look on the bright side... uh...</p>
<p>damn, not a very good night for bright sides</p>
