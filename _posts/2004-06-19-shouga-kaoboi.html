<p>My parents left yesterday morning, and I want to write a big post about it, but I'm still processing... it was a bit of a whirlwind.  So for now I give you the recipe for the new drink sweeping Japan, Asia, and the World:</p>
<p><strong>生姜カオボイ</strong><br />
1/9 生姜シロップ *<br />
5/9 豆乳<br />
3/9 好きなウィスキー</p>
<p>* 生姜シロップ = 切った生姜 （黒）砂糖 水 を煮染めて <!--more 英語で - n'English--></p>
<p><strong>The Shouga Kaoboi</strong><br />
1/9 Ginger Syrup *<br />
5/9 Unsweetened Soy Milk<br />
3/9 Whiskey of choice</p>
<p>* Ginger Syrup = equal parts ginger slices, (brown) sugar, and water boiled down to 1/2 consistency... it gets syrupy.  You can then bake the leftover ginger slices at 110 C for a couple hours to make ginger candy.  Coat them in sugar first if you want them to turn out like crystallized ginger.  I sliced mine super-thin, and they only took an hour to dry out into sweet/ginger-spicy chippy things. Yum. Also, the syrup can be mixed with soda water for ginger ale, easy-peasy.</p>
