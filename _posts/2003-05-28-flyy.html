<p>I was supposed to be in the air now... actually transferring in Atlanta, but almost in the air. Japanese beurocracy saw to my being here now instead. They say the 16th, but I'm not paying for another ticket til I have the visa stuff in my hands. What a pain.</p>
<p>But there is a bright side.</p>
