_Pros:_

Grand vision to bring bodies, materials, spaces, and face-to-face interaction to dynamic media (computation). No wires or glasses needed.

_Cons:_

Focused locally for now, so if you can't make it to Oakland, "wait a couple years."

(The con is a frustration for me, but we have to respect their focus on their first space.)

I spent the afternoon at Dynamicland. I've never learned a new language and made something cool, worth building on, in one afternoon, but that's what happened there. So even at this early stage, the platform is very intriguing. I can't stop thinking about it.

Here's my little hack:

As a child of the [Folk School](http://folkschool.org/), and also a lifelong media/code artist/hacker, I've tried to make the sides of my interests intersect in different ways. 10 years ago, I helped get bookmaker and weaver friends online with websites and videos to show their work. My [thesis project](https://meemoo.org/) encourages media hacking and playing with materials to make [stop-motion gifs](http://meemoo.org/hack-tivities/abc.html), [physical animations](http://meemoo.org/hack-tivities/physical-gif.html), and [projections](https://vimeo.com/38103181).

But Dynamicland puts media _into_ materials. When I saw the first demos start to leak on [@Dynamicland1](https://twitter.com/Dynamicland1), I had the feeling that my thesis had grown legs and continued evolving without me.

Some thoughts from other people:

> A workshop for programmers.... It is also clearly more than that, a project that aims to bring the dynamism of programming to those who cannot not tolerate the environment that programming currently demands.

> What if seeing spaces aren't just tools for an individual to see inside, see across time, and see across possibilities? What if seeing spaces are really supposed to be spaces for facilitating everyone seeing those things? All your colleagues, all your friends, all your stakeholders, all in the same space, able to see all the data and all the tools, gaining a shared understanding? Isn't that what a big room is for? Getting a bunch of people in it?

> If we believe the group’s self-perception, their technologies are, just like hacks, tentative interim solutions for something bigger that might arrive one day. The radical engineers would also be the first to state that the same interim solutions, if stopped in their development and reified too early, are potential sources of hacks in the derogatory sense. The latter is, according to their stories, exactly what happened when, 40 years ago, the prototypes left the labs too soon, and entered the world of Apple, IBM, and Microsoft, producing the accumulation of bad decisions that led to a world where people stare at smartphones.
