<p>I had traffic court, and they dropped it b/c it was my first moving violation. Luckily they called me "Michael Dysart," and they were doing it in alphabetical order, so I got out quick. I wonder if the alphabetical order of one's last name affects outlook on life... If the Zmoleks and Zdanowiczes of the world see it differently, b/c they are always at the end of the line. They could be bitter about it easily, but I'd bet some have lower than average blood pressure.</p>
