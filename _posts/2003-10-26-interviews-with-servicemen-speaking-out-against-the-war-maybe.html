<p><i>"Bring us home now; weâ€™re dying for oil and corporate greed!"</i><br />
I can't find much info on the author/interviewer for these interviews, and I'm wondering if they are real. They seem fake in some ways, but in other ways they seem almost too gritty to be fake. I guess they could always be fake, but if they <i>are</i> fabrications then they are pretty amazingly done. So who is this Jay Shaft character? And who are <a href="http://www.scoop.co.nz/mason/stories/HL0310/S00194.htm">the GI</a>, <a href="http://www.scoop.co.nz/mason/stories/HL0310/S00142.htm">Sarge</a>, <a href="http://www.scoop.co.nz/mason/stories/HL0310/S00116.htm">Trooper 1</a>, and <a href="http://www.scoop.co.nz/mason/stories/HL0310/S00105.htm">USA</a>? Their style <i>does</i> remind me of a "debate" I had with an ex-marine/jet a few weeks ago. I just don't know.</p>
