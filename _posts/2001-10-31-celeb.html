<p>I went to PTA after class & started work on my costume, a huge feathery bedsheet hooded suit that fits over my stilts, + extended arms (last minute addition) ... went up to Franklin St. where there were throngs of people, belligerent drunk assholes and otherwise. Was shoved down in a crowd, the girl came back & said she was pushed, not true but I don't care. Tons of people got pictures with me, but I have yet to see the full effect.</p>
<p>Can see the height aspect here:<a href="http://www.unc.edu/~phuzo/forresto/halloween/frank_fo_joanie.JPG"><img width="96" height="128" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/frank_fo_joanie.JPG" /></a></p>
