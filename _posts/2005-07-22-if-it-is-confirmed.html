<p>I just got the email, looks like I'm going to <a href="http://www.nih.dk/internationalMain.asp">make my dream come true</a> at Nordjyllands Idrætshøjskole... now I just have to figure out how to <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/forresto/28075038/">get to Denmark</a> in 16 days.  That's right... intensive sports training in Denmark will be occupying me for the rest of this year.</p>
