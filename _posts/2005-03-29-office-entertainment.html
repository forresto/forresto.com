<p>Haha, somebody just called T.z. and ordered 18 cups of coffee for a meeting or something, which is not her job.  She said 「分かった」 (understood) and hung up, and then said 「むかつく」 (the nerve...) under her breath.  Then she happily remembered something is up with the water here, so she called back and said 「水でないからできない」 (the water isn't working so I cant).  And a click.  You go girl.</p>
<p>I think this boldness is connected to possible 転勤 (transfers) come April.</p>
