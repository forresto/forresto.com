<p><em>"<a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/download/">Hell Froze Over</a>"</em><br />
(I'll check it out when I get home.)</p>
<p>So I've checked it out, and it seems quite solid. I'm not in the <a href="http://www.allofmp3.com/">mood</a> to buy music, so I don't know how well that works, and I am liking <a href="http://www.musicex.com/mediacenter/">Media Center</a> too much to make iTunes my jukebox. Media Center copies the layout of Apple's iTunes, but improves on it by recognizing cover art in the album directories and giving minute, nerdy control over everything in the program. It also supports ogg vorbis, which I have a few of. In conclusion, I'll use iTunes for internet radio and occasionally perusing the Music Store, but probably won't buy anything b/c I'm not a huge fan of the codec and copy protection that they use.</p>
