<p>Bristol was lovely. While Minta was at the Ortho I took a nap at her house, and had a strange dream... I was using a telephone menu system, and each keyed entry would reward me with a girl doing a freestyle rap. She was really good, but after pushing one of the numbers she confided (in rhythm and rhyme, of course) that somebody else was writing the lyrics for her. I was close to making the realization that it was <strong>me</strong> that was her Cyrano, but Minta came in and dropped her keys on my stomach. If I had figured it out while still dreaming I might have gone into a coma.</p>
<p>Do people meet themselves in dreams?</p>

Daniel didn't finish editing <a href="http://surgenetwork.org/moratorium/">the video</a>, so I'll be doing the encoding tomorrow. Funfunfun.</p>
