<p>The sun came out! Incredible. After class I headed straight for the square with my banjo, and got comfortable with the people ignoring me (just as before). I fought my nerves, and even sang a little bit... I don’t reeeeally know the words, but I know some of them, make up the rest. It felt good.</p>
<p>Then something happened... somebody stopped and watched me. He showed interest in me for me, and even gave me a smile and a giggle. He stood there for a couple minutes, but then his dad made him get back in the stroller. And all the hopes for humanity in the city now lie with a child, a toddler not old enough to know what feeling pissed and bored is all about.</p>
