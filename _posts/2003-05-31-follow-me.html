<p>I'm smitten, smooted, smote, smited, smirched, and stoked.</p>
<p>In other news, my grandparents are in town visiting the compound. I got a piano lesson last night from Daniel, and he told me to learn the song I've been practicing in four keys. We'll see if my brain can actually wrap around that in a week, but it feels nice to be challenged like that.</p>
<p>I'm also not in Japan. The plane flew without me. Waiting, waiting, waiting.</p>
