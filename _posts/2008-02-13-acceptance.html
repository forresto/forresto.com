<p>Things have been busy enough that I have not had time to think, process, dwell.  A cold knocked me out of the race this week though, slowing me down enough to do all of those things.  I feel like I need to be back there.  </p>
<p>Monday night I dreamt he was back.  He was sitting on the dresser, behind the door.  I went downstairs, and saw my dad, and told him that I was afraid that I was hallucinating.  So my subconscious knows it he gone, but my subconscious' subconscious does not?  But dad acted as if I was just the last one to know that he was back.  "We figured you would find out sooner or later."  I then woke up within the dream, and told people about the dream, and how it upset me, but then he was still there.  Somehow I decided that I was not dreaming this time, so that made it more upsetting when I actually woke up.  </p>
<p>My hacking cold confirmed that this awakening was real.</p>
<p>Thinking about Martha's and then David's voice cracking as they battled through <i>The Happy Sunny Side Of Life</i> really gets to me, every time.  I need to be back there for some time soon.</p>
