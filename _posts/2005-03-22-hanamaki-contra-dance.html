<p>What may be Japan's first contra dance went very well this<br />
Sunday.... I was nervous because it was the first time that I<br />
have put together a program and called all of the dances. The<br />
program works slowly to the contra dance concept, and the crowd was<br />
able to get it. I should have concentrated on how to get back<br />
into the dance from waiting out on the ends more when teaching, because<br />
that's how all of the contras seemed to break down around 3.5 or 4<br />
minutes into the dance. Maybe 3 minute musical tracks are the<br />
answer. Anyhow, I was thrilled that it worked as well as it did,<br />
especially since we were working with a language barrier and a<br />
mostly-beginner crowd.</p>
<p>I was a little bit nervous about calling, as well, because I haven't in awhile. For most of the drive down to Hanamaki I played my contra mix and called the dances out loud. I bet that looked funny to other drivers. Once we started dancing it all worked out like riding a bicycle... I was calling and flat-footing like I was born to do it. It was fun! I only yelled at them once, and I think they forgave.... 待って待って待って！ (sheepish grin)</p>
<p>Presbyterians are always talking about looking for their "calling." I think I might have found my calling -- being, ahem, calling -- for at least my time in Japan.</p>
