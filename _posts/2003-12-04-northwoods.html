Always a sucker for a good conspiricy theory, as well as good comics. This guy's <a href="http://mackwhite.com/zircon.html">stuff</a> is good, in addition to this <a href="http://mackwhite.com/northwoods.html">Kennedy one</a> there is one of John Lennon called "<a href="http://mackwhite.com/lennon.html">Dead Silence in the Brain</a>" and a fiction worth reading called "<a href="http://mackwhite.com/cindy1.html">Cindy the Tattooed Sunday School Teacher</a>." That last one is the reason this post is friends-only... wouldn't want grandma stumbling across that!</p>
