<p>I had an intense nap dream...</p>
<p><b>Scene I.</b><br />
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/forresto/3678296/"><img class="picture" src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/3/3678296_e38cd39b53_o.jpg" alt="03_11_28_14_25" title="no diving this side" align="right" /></a>A little girl and her caretaker were on a stage with black curtains. The caretaker had a bag of groceries, and was trying to get the little girl's attention with each thing. The little girl didn't care about anything, though, and was playing her caretaker's insecurities like a record. Until, of course, the corn starch was pulled out of the bag. Then the girl wanted it like a crackhead would want crack, she wanted to mix it with water and play with it (wouldn't we all), but the caretaker, now that she had the upper hand, just teased the little girl.<br />
<b>Scene II.</b><br />
A boy of second or third grade age has decided that becoming an alcoholic will enhance his decision to drop out of school. He has a six-pack of beer.<br />
<b>Scene III.</b><br />
I am playing with the corn-starch play-dough, and find a human finger-bone inside, and pull it out, slowly.</p>
