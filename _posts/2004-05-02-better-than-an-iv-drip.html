<p>I've been bedridden for the past 35 hours. A stomach bug came out of nowhere and swept me off my feet; clotheslined me and gave me the Ethiopian Elbow for good measure. I called my folks for pity, and my mom gave me this recipe for hydration when your body won't keep even water down: <strong>drink one tablespoon of water every 15 minutes</strong>, and that will keep you hydrated without causing ejection. I love little tidbits of medical wisdom that you can pass on like this. I got to the point where I was really looking forward to that one tbsp of water.</p>
<p>Today is the Koiwai Bluegrass Festival, but I can't go now. I'm back on my feet, but not really up for four hours of driving and camping and all that. This is a huge bummer, b/c Ethan said there are a bunch of oldtimers and an oldtime jam section in the campground. I thought that was funny... the oldtimers make their ghetto here just like in the states.</p>
<p>But hey, It's only 6:30... maybe I will try and make it.</p>
