<p>I had my first dream thinking that I was already in Japan.</p>
<p>I met Miyuki Michue somewhere downtown, and I got on a bus, but she was coming along as well, apparently. She didn't get on, she stayed on the step, and when we reached the destination I figured out that was because she didn't want to pay. I went inside to pay for her, pulled out a big wad of bills in a plastic zip-lock bag.</p>
<p>Then we were in a convenience store and she covered my eyes and said there was a surprise for me. "Look out the door and to your left." There were Ellie Blake, and David, Emolyn, Annie Fain, and Lindsey Liden. I was surprised to see them, and we danced around a little, but I had to go.</p>
<p>The Saturn was parked in the left lane of traffic, and everybody was waiting. They were in the wrong lane for Japan. Hmm... I tried to start the engine, but it stalled. I made sure I was pushing the clutch all the way in (driving stick in my dreams now!), but it would not start, so I rolled to a parking lot. David and Lindsey walked up, and David said: "Remember, lefty loosey, righty tighty." </p>
<p>That didn't help.</p>
