<p>Thankfully i did not fail my philosophy class... Actually did much the opposite. I'm afraid to see the TA around campus tho... the last impression was that exam I bombed so horribly.</p>
<p>... which means I'll be able to do my thesis.</p>
<p>Flicker gave me a roll of super 8, i think i'll give it to Aisling, cuz she has a super 8 camera. Mine's not-so-super 8... more like bland 8, i guess you would say.</p>
<p>Somebody at flicker said phase 5 was beautifully shot... I wonder if he is a podifile?</p>
<p>I also wonder if kudzu makes good baskets.</p>
