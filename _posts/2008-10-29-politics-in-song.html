<h2>Obama</h2>
<p> The first political song endorsing a candidate this season that I heard was this reggaeton jam: <!--more--><br />

<p>Now it looks like they have <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jlti12dTVQI">norte&ntilde;o</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fd-MVU4vtU">mariachi</a> songs as well.</p>
<p>En français we have Dirk Powell and co. doing a little zydeco for our shimmying pleasure:<br />

<h2>McCain</h2>
<p> There was also that Will.i.am <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjXyqcx-mYY">Yes We Can</a> thing, but it was kinda weird, and the pro-McCain spoof is much better:<br />

<p>In the interest of fair and balanced coverage I'll link to Hank Williams Jr. nonsensically-titled <a href="http://indyweek.com/slideshows/Palin/">McCain-Palin Tradition</a>.  Since I didn't fact-check the Spanish songs I'll let Hank say what ever he wants, but his "most of the American people" line in the first verse is just wrong.  Unless he is talking about just most of <a href="http://www.thedailyshow.com/video/index.jhtml?videoId=188638&amp;title=understanding-real-america-in">Real America</a>.  I'm a fan of <a href="http://www.electoral-vote.com/evp2008/Pres/Carto/Oct28-c.html">this version of the electoral map</a> these days when I need a little reminding about what "most" of America is saying in the polls.</p>
<h2>Bipartisan</h2>
<p> JibJab always serves up entertaining stuff, they have taken their one-trick pony to the top of the trick show.  Here is their rollicking fun <a href="http://sendables.jibjab.com/sendables/1191/time_for_some_campaignin">Time for Some Campaignin'</a>.  Don't forget the words of the song that this is based on this coming year.</p>
<p>I saved the most fun (and balanced) for last, these kids totally rock:<br />

<p>There are too many more for you to explore as well.  Looking at the first pages of youtube results for each, most <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=obama+song">Obama songs</a> are pro-Obama, while most <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=mccain+song">McCain songs</a> are against McCain.  Not very surprising.</p>
