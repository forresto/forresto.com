<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/forresto/3678200/"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/2/3678200_1630c5c084_o.jpg" alt="my board" class="picture" align="right" /></a>I've been in the ocean a lot this week. Not as much as Hana, who works the red eye as a bar tender in Hachinohe and then surfs for 5-8 hours before sleeping... but a lot. My body has that nice letting-you-know-that-it-is-there feeling that come with taking up a new sport, and it feels good to be alive.</p>
<p>I've face-planted into the water more times than I can count. The wave smashes over me and makes me tumble around--makes me forget which way is up and which is down. I hold my breath and think about what went wrong, then surface, ready to try again. Today I did better, my body is learning where it has to shift its weight to keep the nose of the board above water. Now I just have to figure out how to stand for more than a moment.</p>
<p>Yesterday I woke up at 4:30 to go out and meet him at Uge beach. It was one of those times in my life where I would have really loved to have had a camera. I'll have no problem remembering it clearly, but I wish I could show an image to the people I love. Fog was clinging to the cliff-like mountains; the clouds were pink with the new day's sun; a local train was slowly making its way around the bend; my new acquaintances were floating in the water next to me with their boards poking out of the water, like funny little sea birds, waiting for the next ridable wave. Truely cinemagraphic.</p>
<p>I stayed till 7:15, then went home to shower before work. I didn't know how my body would handle waking up so early, but I felt more awake than average. Lately I thought that I was malnourishing myself, but my father said that being lethargic is a natural reaction to being trapped in an office 8 hours a day. It is summer vacation, so I don't have classes, but I still have to "work."</p>
<p>A typhoon is coming, so I'm going to head home and make sure my windows are closed. Don't worry mom; I'll stay away from the ocean.</p>
