<p>OK, that's it! I usually try to stay away from the ye olde "why the **** do Japanese people..." ...but I can't take it anymore, so:</p>
<p>Why the **** do Japanese people get squeemish about raw peas, greenbeans, and carrots (u like a rabbit! silly crazy-a foo...), when they will eat the **** out of some raw fish, sea urchin, sea cucumber, shrimp, shellfish, deer, and HORSE!?!?!?!?! Come on... isn't this <em>one</em> cultural difference that could be looked at objectively? Raw meat vs. raw veggies, hmm...</p>
<p>That's all for now.</p>
