<p>I just got really excited about <a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org/">National Novel Writing Month</a> (aka NaNoWriMo) in November. Here is the idea:</p>
<blockquote><p>National Novel Writing Month is a fun, seat-of-your-pants approach to novel writing. Participants begin writing November 1. The goal is to write a 175-page (50,000-word) novel by midnight, November 30.</p>
<p>Valuing enthusiasm and perseverance over talent and craft, NaNoWriMo is a novel-writing program for everyone who has thought fleetingly about writing a novel but has been scared away by the time and effort involved.</p></blockquote>
<p>So hopefully I won't be outputting complete crap, and <a title="link to my nanowrimo profile" href="http://www.nanowrimo.org/profile.php?mode=viewprofile&u=24819">I'll end up</a> with something somebody out there might want to read.</p>
