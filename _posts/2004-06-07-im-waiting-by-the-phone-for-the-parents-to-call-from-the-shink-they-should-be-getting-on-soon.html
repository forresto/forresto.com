<p><small>(I got a little crazy adding food blogs in, they can be quite entertaining... there are some <a title="Condoleezza Rice Pudding with Berries of Mass Destruction" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20040529203731/http://www.amateurgourmet.com/the_amateur_gourmet/2004/05/is_my_blog_burn.html">real food nerds</a> out there. I like <a href="http://www.bloglines.com/">Bloglines</a> because I can now search the blogs that I read--for example for a particular ingredient--and get all of the trusted blogs' posts on that subject. Niftiness.)</small><br />
