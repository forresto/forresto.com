<p>Well a trip to London isn’t complete without going to “a show,” and the Summer School included one today. Blood Brothers has been running for twelve years; it’s a tragedy (melodrama) about twins separated at birth.</p>
<p>At the pub after the show Hap and I talked about Douglas Sirk’s woman-targeted melodramatic films of the fifties. Hap argued that they have different levels, that people looking to be entertained can enjoy it for the visceral pleasure, and that film critics can dissect it and turn it inside out and on its head and just have all kinds of fun with it. Then Hap said that Blood Brothers only had the visceral story, and no other level.</p>
<p>On the way home I remembered my personal declaration that everything can be acadaemized, and went to work on Blood Brothers in my mind. See, it’s a story of two men from the same womb. Their quality of life is nothing near the same, though, because they are raised in disparate social situations. So, the argument is that how one turns out has nothing to do with predeterminal genetics, and everything to do with environment. That’s academic, right? Social psychologists would love to see this in real life.</p>
<p>Not that musicals are not real to life... my echo machine is ready to go whenever I need to say anything at all dramatic. And the synth-drum is in the wings too... pow!</p>
