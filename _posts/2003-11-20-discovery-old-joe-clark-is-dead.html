I was just messing with recordings I am making for Folktunes.org, and I played Cripple Creek in reverse and discovered a pretty cool tune in there. I'm gonna learn how to play it now, like this, and then I guess I'll have to rereverse like that guy on America's Funniest Whatevers way back when. I wonder what he is up to now.</p>
