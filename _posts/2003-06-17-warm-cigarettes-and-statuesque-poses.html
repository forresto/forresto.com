<p><nobr>warm cigarettes and statuesque poses<br />
my hand in your pocket your hand in my heart<br />
shoes tied together we sniff the blue roses<br />
what brought us together will pull us apart</p>
<p>i, on my way with a shuffle and skip<br />
you looked at me sideways as the room spun<br />
next to the fire your teeth cut my lip<br />
i saw by my eyes that <i>it</i> had begun</p>
<p>so i'll be your woman if you are my man<br />
or maybe i'm thinking in upsidedown terms<br />
and if it works out that we meet in japan<br />
we'll laugh and we'll love, we'll dance and we'll learn</nobr></p>
