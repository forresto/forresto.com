<p>I had the strangest sensation today.</p>
<p>In the middle of class, allofasudden I (felt like I) was in Barnes & Noble.  I could see the sections of the store, remember every little thing about it.  I went into the Asheville store once over vacation, and it felt like time had looped itself back to that day with Minta.  But it obviously hadn't, so I laughed at myself.  I shouldn't have been laughing, so my laughing made me laugh a bit more.</p>
<p>This was bad, because I was in the middle of a "repeat after me" section of the textbook about Rachel Carson and DDT and the sad little momma birds with the too-soft eggs.  It is the only chapter in the textbook that I actually care for, because it is about something real and it challenges the kids.</p>
<p>Everybody looked up at me, the teacher as well.  I cleared my throat and continued.</p>
<p>So that was the funny thing today.</p>
<p>I also made an 8mm tiny with all the folds: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/forresto/4194682/" title="8mm crane"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/4194682_934f09f67d_s.jpg" width="75" height="75" alt="8mm crane" class="picture" align="absmiddle" /></a>, a new PR.</p>
