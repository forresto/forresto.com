<p><strong><a href="http://wiggle.sourceforge.net/">LOOK!</a></strong>  I just released a usable version of the software I have been working on in my downtime at school.  I would be much obliged if you were to want to try it out.  What does it do, you ask?  Well, it lines up a pair of photos and motionblurs between them to give a neato mosquito 3D effect.  The idea is "time for space," where time is the animation timeline and space is the distance between your eyes.</p>
<p>First question, for those that want to help <em>right quick</em>:  Does <a href="http://wiggle.sourceforge.net/">this</a> and this screencap look roughly the same in your various browsers?  If not, I've screwed something up that needs fixing.</p>
<p>If you want to make your own wiggly things, download it from the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=109131">Wiggle Release Page</a> (save it, unzip it, and you can figure it out from there).  Questions for those that try it out:  Does source.html work in your browser?  Does it line up your image sets correctly?  Would you submit a WiggleSet to be featured on the project page?</p>
