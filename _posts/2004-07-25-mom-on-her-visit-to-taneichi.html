Forrest,<br />
<br />It is hard to write on demand you know.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/forresto/3639794/"><img alt="100_0040" src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/2/3639794_a2e14c8226_n.jpg" align="right" class="picture" style="clear:right;" /></a>It was hard to not feel special in Japan. Kids clapping and asking for<br />
our autographs. I realized that an American family is not found there<br />
very often.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/forresto/3639825/"><img alt="100_0048" src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/3/3639825_6e0104d984_n.jpg" align="left" class="picture" style="clear:left;" /></a>Friends and workers gathering to visit with us... such a nice ego boost<br />
to be the center of attention and for everyone to say how much they liked<br />
Forrest. It made homecoming so hard.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/forresto/3641400/"><img alt="101_0207" src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/2/3641400_f01f7bf1bb_n.jpg" align="right" class="picture" style="clear:right;" /></a>I tell our friends here that we had the "wild" Japan tour. Up cliffs,<br />
down cliffs, up mountains and down, hiking through the gorge and <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/forresto/3641180/"><img alt="101_0129" src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/2/3641180_baa4b47c66_n.jpg" align="left" class="picture" style="clear:left;" /></a>being<br />
picked up by the 'cuckoo' man to be shown the back stage scene of flying<br />
dango. Wasabe land,  so green.</p>
<p>Our first Ryokan, scrubbing extra long  because you said to.... Claire<br />
saying," I think we have scrubbed twice as long as anyone else, lets go!"</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/forresto/3639815/"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/1/3639815_89b4d8a4f5_n.jpg" align="right" class="picture" style="clear:right;" /></a>I liked the food adventure too. Am I the only family member to experience<br />
Uni, <a href="http://folktunes.org/forresto/galleries/0406padresVisit/100_0047.mov" title="wiggling uni quicktime .mov">moving....</a>?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/forresto/3641469/"><img alt="101_0244" src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/2/3641469_7914902067_n.jpg" align="left" class="picture" style="clear:left;" /></a>I was most impressed with the gardens. Any space available had some type<br />
of garden. Flowers and food, I loved walking about the towns.<br />
I would love to live there, if I thought I could ever understand<br />
anything. I was  impressed by all the English teachers taking that jump<br />
into such initial isolation.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/forresto/3641352/"><img alt="101_0193" src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/2/3641352_7f5d9c7d85_n.jpg" align="right" class="picture" style="clear:right;" /></a>The trip made me grateful to experience such a place, knowing that it<br />
would not have happened without you. I'm happy to know where and how you<br />
live, meet some of your friends and co workers and students, and see how<br />
much they like you.</p>
<p>And we like miso soup.</p>
<p>Love,<br />
<br />Mom</p>
