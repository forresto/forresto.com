<ol>
<li>What is the Japanese product sold in the above packaging? (to level the playing field for those that don't read Japanese, it says: <i>Pop Teen Tobacco Size, contains 6</i>, and no fair guessing if you already know)</li>
<li>What is the word for the shape of the negative space of a well?</li>
<li>When you are happy (and you know it, and you want to show it) does that mean you are actually happy, or does it mean that you are just are happy because other people want you to be?</li>
</ol>
