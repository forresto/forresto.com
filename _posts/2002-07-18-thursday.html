<p>Class, then everybody buggered off to either Oslo or Stockholm. I am going to Arasvika tomorrow to visit the friend's friends that have a farm and turn cows into salami. I am packed and ready to go for that, so I wonder around looking for something to do. I play my banjo in this little garden next to a bridge, and get some curious looks from passers-by. Banjo (aka banyo) is not too well known here,,, imagine that. I come back to Moholt student housing and hang out with two of the kids I met on Saturday. Learn two reasons Norway is not perfect: that the Christian party taxes beer like crazy and that the state healthcare sucks. </p>
<p> Watch <i>Yellow Submarine</i> with the commentary on, just for fun.</p>
