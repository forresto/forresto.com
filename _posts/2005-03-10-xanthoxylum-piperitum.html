<p>Today at school the teachers were laughing at the principal, because he called in <strike>drunk</strike> sick... twice... one hour apart saying the exact same thing to the same person.  I was supposed to have 3 solo classes today, but there were no students due to INFRUENZA (Godzilla's second cousin).</p>

All the expats around me seem to be entering the "I hate everything about this place" phase of living in Japan.  They have valid points, and I can feel their frustration, but... I dunno, I think I'm stuck in the "Turning Japanese I think I'm..." phase.  Nothing has been getting to me at all.  I guess my mind is elsewhere.</p>
<p>Like hobbies!  New hobbies: swimming and salsa piano.  2/3 clave is getting into my bones and I'm swallowing much less water and covering much more water than 2 weeks ago.</p>
<p>I cooked with wuxiang fen (anise, cinnamon, clove, fennel, and 花椒) today, and my house smells so good.  Yesterday it was pumpkin bread.</p>
