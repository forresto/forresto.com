<p>You continue to treat me well.  Since my last entry I have some new regular activities including Sunday "church" singing with the <a href="http://www.ncshapenote.org/">Shape Note Singers of Research Triangle Area</a>, Monday Argentine Tango classes with <a href="http://www.tangophilia.com/">Tangophilia</a>, Tuesday clogging with <a href="http://www.canecreekcloggers.org/">Cane Creek Cloggers</a>, Wednesday old-time jams at <a href="http://nightlight.dyss.net/">Nightlight</a>, and Friday <a href="http://www.tcdancers.org/localdance.html">contra dances</a>.  Chloe has promised to get me lindy hopping too which will be cool, I think those are Saturdays.  The irregular activities more than fill in the other nights.</p>
<p>I move to my new place Thursday.  I'll miss squatting at <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=27510&t=h&ll=35.918502,-79.08349&spn=0.000984,0.002983&t=h">the estate</a>, but will be here much in the future too.  Me and the estate boys are starting our own Shape Note quartet.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, it looks like I might have a contract job now too.</p>
<p>And a first date tonight.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br />
