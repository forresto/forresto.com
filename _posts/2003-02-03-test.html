<p>I was tested last night in a dream, she wanted me back all of </p>
<p>a sudden. The eyes of the crowd bored into ours, and I didn't </p>
<p>know how to react. We were in a bed in the middle of the </p>
<p>party, and I remember the negative looks from all around as I </p>
<p>capitulated and kissed her waiting mouth. T's face was the </p>
<p>most clear in the crowd, and was clearly astonished and/or </p>
<p>disappointed. I couldn't figure out if it was in me or her.</p>
