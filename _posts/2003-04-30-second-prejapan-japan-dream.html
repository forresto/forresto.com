<p>I was teaching English to a class of ~10 year olds, first day on the job in Japan. The kid I was helping was white with blond hair, but Japanese somehow. The American guy I was replacing came in, and we spoke in Japanese for a bit. I then looked around the classroom, and all of the kids were white with blond hair.</p>
