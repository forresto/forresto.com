<p>I love that all of my Nakano 3-nensei students sang <em>Oh Happy Day</em>--the old gospel song--together. They sure haven't got all of those old hang-ups here. They did really well, considering that they are middle schoolers. The younger kids go around talking about how great it was. They use "O happy day?" as a standard greeting now, which makes me laugh. Praise Jesus!</p>
