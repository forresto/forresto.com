<p>O grievous the fate<br />
That attends upon wrong!<br />
Stern ghost of our sire,<br />
Thy vengeance is long!<br />
Dark Fury of hell and of death, the hands of thy kingdom are strong!</p>
<p>O dark were the sorrows<br />
That exile hath known!<br />
He slew, but returned not<br />
Alive to his own!<br />
He struck down a brother, but fell, in the moment of triumph hewn down!</p>
<p>O lineage accurst,<br />
O doom and despair!<br />
Alas, for their quarrel,<br />
The brothers that were!<br />
And woe! for their pitiful end, who once were our love and our care!</p>
<p>O grievous the fate<br />
That attends upon wrong!<br />
Stern ghost of our sire,<br />
Thy vengeance is long!<br />
Dark  Fury of hell and of death,  the hands of thy kingdom are strong!</p>
<p>By proof have ye learnt it!<br />
At once and as one,<br />
O brothers beloved,<br />
To death ye were done!<br />
Ye came to the  strife of the sword, and behold! ye are both overthrown!</p>
