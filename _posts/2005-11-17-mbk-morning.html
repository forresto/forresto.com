<p>This morning I was sleepily walking the halls after cleaning (7am...<br />
souji time, how Japanese, huh), and the Adventure class teacher said<br />
"you look tired, don't worry, we'll wake you up this morning."  So 8am<br />
I go out to Adventure class walking though the frost-stiff grass and<br />
find out that we're to do ten laps of the 1.4k mountain bike circuit.<br />
Fourteen kilometers isn't much on a bike, but it took me an hour (and<br />
forty-four seconds) of rough work to finish, because it's all slowing<br />
down, speeding up, up hills, 'round corners, and all that.  There are<br />
no mountains in Denmark, so they had to make everything up on this<br />
circuit, and did a pretty good job.  Through the woods, over<br />
buildings, cutting up and down banks (aim right or you'll be in a<br />
bush), across the tops of embankments... all in the frosty morn.  It<br />
was a semi-goal of mine to make it around at least once without<br />
putting my feet down, but I didn't.</p>
