<p>Running up the hill was excruciatingly hard. I went to the folk school, they were shooting a movie there, and there were tons of extras. The scene was a graduation thing, and all the extras were in ties. The female AD asked me if I wanted to be in this scene with the "A" group, or if I wanted a more "personal" part. I was wearing a ratty dark green t-shirt with a disney chipmunk silkscreend on the front. I went to my tent, played with Misty for a little bit, got another shirt, then went to see the casting director. He put me in a scene with a band, maybe lead guitar, with his friend's son. We shook on it, I was excited, but he looked stoned, so I didn't know if I trusted him.</p>
