<p>Look at my new index design... very experimental... I'm trying to have a lot of information crammed into one page, but still be readable.</p>
<p><a href="http://forresto.com/oldsite/2005_index.html"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2005_magnifies.png" alt="magnifies" /></a></p>
<p>The TOC links on the left don't move, and they magnify the corresponding section on the page.  The fisheye magnify effect is inspired in part by the OS X dock, with the hovered section getting bigger, the surrounding sections a little smaller, and everything else the smallest readable (in CSS: large, small, xx-small).  The javascript behind the effect is pretty simple.  I even figured how to get it to work in IE 6.</p>
<p>Since I'm just playing I don't really mind that it isn't the most usable design in the world, but if you have any critiques or suggestions, let me have 'em.  I'd especially like to know if it works in Opera, IE 5, or Safari.</p>
