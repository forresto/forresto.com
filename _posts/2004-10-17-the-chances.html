<p>I was going to blow off the speech contest that I had signed up for a couple of months ago... but I sucked it up and went. It was cool to see the difference in everybody's Japanese levels. Got 10000en for my trouble, which was a nice surprise. I thought we were just going to get a nomikai and free accommodation, which we did, with Cave Beer to boot. I stayed at "Trailer Home One." It was a trailer home. We made ourselves at home.</p>
<p>So with the surprise money I decided to get an oil changed & fill up my tank. I went by the Tutoriba and asked when they closed, went surfing, then back to the station to have the deed done. I was 3km from the 4000km oil-change mark. I walked into the waiting room and read a thumbmail from Mia, who said that Taneichi's team represented at the Taiko fest folks went to in Akita.</p>
<p>I started to write back, but then on the news in the station was the Taneichi team (<em>Taneichi Minamidaiko</em>), and the next shot was Mia, right there on the TV (watching them).</p>
<p><small>PS: The cost for oil change + gas came out perfect (10000).</small></p>
