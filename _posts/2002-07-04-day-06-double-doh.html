<p>“Late again,” said Eeyore sadly.</p>
<p>This time I didn’t look so bad, because all three the guys in my room managed to sleep through our alarms, and there was a fire alarm in the class building, so apparently we didn’t miss that much of class. Still felt pretty dumb... ah well, enough crying over spilt milk.</p>
