<p><a title=".mp3 of &quot;Napoleon Crossing The Rhine&quot; with distortion" href="http://www.forresto.com/oldsite/music/randomocity/Naporock.mp3" style="text-decoration:none"><span style="padding:5px;margin-right:5px;background-color:white;float:left;border:1px #cccccc dotted;"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/mp3.png" width="34" height="41" style="padding-right:5px;vertical-align:middle" border="0" alt="mp3" />Naporock.mp3</span></a>Yeah, so Macs do have their merits, I guess... I just got to play with <a href="http://www.apple.com/ilife/garageband/">GarageBand</a> for the first time, and it lets you play and monitor the filter at the same time. Anyhow, this is me rocking out on <em>Napoleon Crossing The Rhine</em> with some mad distortion.  Tom, the ever-purist, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20040705075640/http://110am.com/blog.php?id=62">has the non-distorted version over at 110am</a>.  Anyhow, this is the first test for recording with my mic and amp into his computer, and eventually we are going to get Daniel and Elizabeth up here to cut some tracks.  Sadly, they prolly won't let me put the RAWK on my banjo... ah well.  I guess I'll be the moody one of the band, and have to break off and go solo.</p>
