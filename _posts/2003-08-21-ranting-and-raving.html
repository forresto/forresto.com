<p>i plan on making a ton of mistakes, and getting into a ton of trouble, and i'll do it in spite of you, and i'll do it despite you, and i'll do it to spite you.<br />
...<br />
humans are freaks on earth, our K--carrying capacity--is only one hundred and eight. we haven't figured that out yet, since we have been looking in the wrong direction. up and up and up. once we hit fifty billion we will figure it out, over seventy years all but one hundred and eight will die.<br />
...<br />
after the epidemic one of the original one hundred and eight recorded an oral history of his lifetime--one hundred and eight years--onto a titanium lp. last night i succeeded in melting it down.</p>
