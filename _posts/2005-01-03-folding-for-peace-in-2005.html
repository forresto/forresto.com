I had to run all over the room and get all up in the big momma to fold her.  I got tons of nice words from those who knew, and saw people pointing up all night, and saw lots of folks taking pictures.  I even overheard Hanne saying that she would leave it up for a few weeks.</p>
<p>Jan thanked me in passing at the dance, and I said I was just trying to make up for "the thing with the..." and did an wavy sign in the air for the celtic knot I accidentally mowed in one of their hay fields 4.5 years ago.  It took him a second to get what I was saying, but then he gave me a big laugh as he walked off.</p>
<p>Thanks to the Folk School and Nanette for giving me the paper and space, Gloria Zmolek for <a href="http://www.unc.edu/~laurel/bigpig.html">big origami inspiration</a>, and the decoration crew for helping me get them flying, especially Tajia, Anne's grandfather, and my parents.</p>
