<p>The BBC says that most people are bad at telling fake smiles from real, and try to explain it by saying that "it may be easier for people to get along if they don't always know what others are really feeling."  They have a test where you look at 20 smiles and guess whether they were real or not.  Those English sure do look funny.  Anyhow, I did fairly well on the test (17/20), but <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/humanbody/mind/surveys/smiles/index.shtml">take it for yourself</a> before you look at the ones I missed: <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/apps/ifl/science/humanbody/mind/surveys/smiles/log2results?gender=male&age=21&occupation=Education/training&country=UNITED%20STATES%20OF%20AMERICA&education=Degree%20level&outlook=3&confidence=5&programme=no&Q01=genuine&Q02=fake&Q03=fake&Q04=genuine&Q04=genuine&Q06=genuine&Q07=fake&Q08=genuine&Q09=fake&Q10=genuine&Q11=genuine&Q12=genuine&Q13=fake&Q14=fake&Q15=genuine&Q16=genuine&Q17=genuine&Q18=fake&Q19=genuine&Q20=genuine&part=eyes">*</a>. I was right about the part of the face to focus on to tell.  I have a thesis about this, which could become a comic this week.</p>
