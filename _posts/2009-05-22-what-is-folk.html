<p>Seattle is cool so far.  Walking too far up Pike Street last night I missed the hotel and went on to East Pike, but it was cool to see that neighborhood and there was lots going on.  Somebody jumped onto the sidewalk and meowed at me, which made me happy.  I saw somebody biking with an accordion strapped on their back, which was another good sign.  </p>
<p>I made a call for Seattle suggestions and got lots, we'll have to see what all I can hit:
<ul>
<li>Mango Margaritas at Agua Verde</li>
<li>Coastal Kitchen on 10th</li>
<li>The Pink Door in the market</li>
<li>Bimbos Bitchin' Burrito Kitchen in Belltown</li>
<li>Metsker Maps</li>
<li>Bahaus coffee shop</li>
<li>Victrola Coffee shop in capital hill</li>
<li>crepes at the Joe Bar</li>
<li>Cyber Dog</li>
<li>Glo's on Capital Hill</li>
<li>VALUE VILLAGE!!!</li>
<li>DICK'S</li>
<li>Ivar's on the waterfront</li>
</ul>
<p>The big draw this weekend is the <a href="http://www.nwfolklife.org/">Northwest Folklife Festival</a>.  Today we volunteered some, wandering around collecting $10 donations in exchange for buttons, which is a hard sell for a non-salesman like me.  The bummer about a free festival is all the badgering for donations, but it is nice that everybody can come out for this.  </p>
<p>The busking bands were the most fun to watch, but since when does every band have a washboard?  I love washboards and all, but at some point it was getting hard to keep track of them all.  ;)  <lj-embed id="5" /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZmI-o9tTOw">Northwest Folklife Washboard Awards 2009</a></p>
<p>At one point I found myself in the middle of Seattle youth culture mishmash central.  It was an overstimulating, interesting mix of hipsterpunk, harajukuhippy, drum jam next to hookah circle next to chiptune gameboy jam* next to breakdance circle.  *Turns out the chiptune scene has an official venue at the festival, the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100713041322/http://www.nwfolklife.org/festival/community-showcases/8-bit-showcase">8 Bit Showcase</a>.  I love that folk festivals are broadening their horizons to be inclusive of weird and wonderful subcultures like this.  What is folk?&nbsp; Folk are folk.</p>
<p>I'll remember my camera tomorrow.</p>
<p>&lt;3s,</p>
