<p>in my dream tigers were all over the town, chasing and attacking us.  i picked up a stool and a ruler to use as a whip, like an old-school lion tamer, but the one in the house turned out to be just a little tiger kitty.  i threw him out by the scruff of his neck.</p>
<p>a few nights ago i had the most beautiful dream.  three people were carrying me over their heads, with speed, in the shallow part of a lake.  i was flying, arms out, through the branches of a tree with pink flowers.  the people would respond to my shifts in weight, giving me full control over my flight.</p>
