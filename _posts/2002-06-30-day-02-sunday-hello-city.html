<p>Sunday is the official start of the program at the Queen’s Larder Pub, not far from where we live. We do introductions, and talk about expectations for the program. Our leader-figure, Hap, is a really nice guy, if a bit thorough. I can tell this month will be a nice time.</p>
<p>Walk around, exploring London. It seems fun, but I can feel a certain gnawing desire to leave. It doesn’t take over me, and I’ll be fine here for two weeks, no problem. It just makes me look forward to Norway, and the small town atmosphere. Something about the isolation that I feel here seems wrong and disturbing, but I can’t really place the feeling.</p>
<p>One thing that struck me yesterday is the lack of tall buildings. Most everything seems to be under ten stories, so it feels quite different than downtown Atlanta or New York. There also seem to be swarms of people on the streets, 24/7 in some areas. Other places seem pretty deserted after 10pm.</p>
