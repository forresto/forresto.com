<p>I'm trying to figure out the best way to get there... I found this round-the world deal for Atlanta - Tokyo - Auckland - Tokyo - Atlanta, which costs as much as two one-way tickets. One-way tickets seem to be consistantly 50% more expensive than round trips... go figure.</p>
<p>Ah, New Zealand in February... how nice does that sound?</p>
