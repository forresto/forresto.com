<p>I'm going to make a livejournal community for all of my kids, and make each one get an account.  The danger of this idea is that I'll have to remember to hide my more bitchy entries, since they will figure out about my journal pretty quick.  I hope this works, and that the teachers I work with will be into it as well.</p>
<p>Haha...<br />
Yesterday I was sitting in the teacher's room & started fidgeting my leg; it shook the desk of Oono Sensei across from me....  He looked up with a slight fear in his eyes, asking if it was an earthquake.</p>
<p>More Haha...<br />
I showed my highschool pic to my employers and some coworkers, and they were all astounded.  What a nice girl! they said, but then after looking at it for a few more minutes they got it.  Saito-sensei said I looked like a Prince!  Hikage-san said I should grow it out again.  Maybe I will, maybe I will. Hey! that will be another project for me this year!</p>
