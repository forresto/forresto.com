<p>I can't even fathom how this happened... it looks like she just put her front brakes on too fast and she rolled right over, maybe pausing at a ninty-degree endo, giving her a moment to think that maybe it would be OK... <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050120000612/http://www.unc.edu/~turnerj/car.html">Cameron Avenue Car Stunt</a>... and this is the kind of thing that if one were on campus one would hear everybody around one taking about... huge news, like the ice storm... ... ... ... naaaaaah, <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/forresto/albums/436449">the ice storm</a> was way cooler.</p>
