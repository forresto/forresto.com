<p>My personal web space has gone through a lot of <a href="http://forresto.com/oldsite/designarchive/">redesigns</a> through the years, but this could be the last.  Why?  It now features an <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060426090556/http://forresto.com/aggregator">aggregator</a> that pulls feeds from <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060426090539/http://forresto.com/aggregator/sources">all</a> of my web postings.  I will still mess with the theme, but I think I'll stick with <a href="http://drupal.org/">Drupal</a> for the backend for a while.</p>
<p>Drupal is by far the best CMS with which I've ever messed.  Structured data is so easy with pathauto and taxonomies.  Look how much <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Afolktunes.org">Google likes</a> the newly Drupal-powered <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060220200400/http://folktunes.org/">folktunes.org</a>.  Enough geeking out about pretty URLs.</p>
<p>While I'm bestowing praise, Dreamhost rocks.  Does anybody need a website?</p>
<p>I've also started the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060615233543/http://forresto.com/beatboxlessons">BboxX - Lessons from a Human Beatbox</a> podcast/blog (<lj user="bboxx" />).  Simple mp3 multivocalism lessons with rhythms broken down.  All for fun.</p>
