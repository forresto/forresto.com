<p><a title="last friday after school" href="http://folktunes.org/forresto/gallery/moblog/04_01_30_15_23"><img class="picture" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/04_01_30_15_23.thumb.jpg" alt="04_01_30_15_23" width="113" height="150" align="left" /></a>Today I went to my Friday school, though it is Tuesday.  We cleaned the gym today as a whole-school activity, and it seemed like one of the most fun things that could have happened in the world.  The whole school is about 30 kids first to ninth grade and 10 teachers, and everybody seemed to be laughing the whole time.  It was a real blast... I love Yamato so much.  I need to come clean, I have a crush on the school nurse.  She told me she was at Appi this weekend too "のに." <a title="&quot;no knee&quot; said with falling pouty inflection = &quot;dang it, if we had only known&quot;" name="noni">*</a></p>
<p><a title="sunset after work today" href="http://folktunes.org/forresto/gallery/moblog/04_02_03_17_23"><img class="picture" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/04_02_03_17_23.thumb.jpg" alt="04_02_03_17_23" width="113" height="150" align="right" /></a><a href="http://www.appi.co.jp/">Appi</a> is the ski resort that I went to Sat and Sun.  It is pretty sweet as far as my limited experience with skiing is concerned.  I was out 8 hours on Saturday and 7 on Sunday, and Daniel (my Chapel Hill frappie / Telluride ski bum friend) helped me get parallel, so I was able to retire the snow plow soon on and built up to some (controlled!) speed by the end.</p>
<p>Manchester Mike has skis and boots to give me, so I'm going to try and try them out on the hill behind my Wednesday school (J&ocirc;nai) tomorrow.</p>
<p>Plus, I played harmonica in my dream last night.</p>
