<p>Japanese humor always seemed to be beyond my grasp, but this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDL8yu34fz0">video on sushi</a> (by <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070413154119/http://osaka.eigasai.com/ssff2005/osaka/o_02.html">these guys</a>) is pretty hilarious if you know a little bit about Japanese culture (some jokes are lost in translation, some are amplified by the subtitles). <small><a href="http://joi.ito.com/archives/2005/12/20/silly_sushi_video.html">[via]</a></small></p>
