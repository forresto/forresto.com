<p>i can't seem to do anything that i am supposed to be doing. which is fine for my <a href="http://ibiblio.org/forresto/ibiblio.html">ibiblio projects</a> and other assorted random crap, but not so good for my thesis or censorship research paper. ah lordy.</p>
<p>speaking of censorship, does anybody have a copy of i am curious - yellow<br />
that i can borrow? the trial surrounding the blocking of the importation<br />
of this film is what i'm going to do research on.</p>
<p>ok peace yall... ps http://kids.forresto.com/ [was a proto-flickr photo sharing site]</p>
