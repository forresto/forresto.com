<p>Both <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20040809010348/http://www.boingboing.net/2004/07/07/farenheit_911_availa.html">BoingBoing</a> and <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/07/09/archive_yeahright_org/">The Register</a> have mistaken <a href="http://www.archive.org/item-reports.php?item_id=8976&mediatype=movies">my error submission</a> for an official comment from The Internet Archive on why they took down <a href="http://www.archive.org/movies/movies-details-db.php?collection=feature_films&collectionid=fahrenheit911">Fahrenheit 9/11</a>. Any archive.org user can make an error report. I'm the dorky hall monitor, NOT the principal. The bootleg that was up there was the same crappy incomplete one that is on all of the filesharing networks, so its being taken down is not hurting anything.<br />
<blockquote>But just hours after putting up the movie, Archive.org pulled it down. In the movie's place was a note that read, "This is under copyright, and archive.org needs to pull it before any damage happens."</p>
<p>Think of this as a child fondling a can of spray paint but then stepping away from the school wall before "any damage happens." Or a seven-year-old contemplating a ten-yard run with scissors in hand and then putting the weapon down before "any damage happens." How ever you think about it. It's clear that there are children running Archive.org - the kind that play copyright gags while doing shots of Pepsi late into the night.</p></blockquote>
<p>(that's from The Register)</p>
