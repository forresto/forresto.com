<p>I saw that Liz Phair had a new one... her Whip-Smart was the 3rd CD I ever bought ever, and I hadn't heard her in awhile, so I decided to check it out....  Let's just say it takes til the 4th song to figure out that it is not a mislabeled new one from Avril Lavigne.</p>
<p>Not that that is a bad thing--my Japanese friends will dig it for sure.</p>
