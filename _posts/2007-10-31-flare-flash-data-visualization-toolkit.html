FIXME
<p>My interest in data visualization can be mapped in this order:
<ol>
<li>Java <a target="_blank" href="http://java.sun.com/applets/jdk/1.3/demo/applets/GraphLayout/example1.html">Graph Layout</a> demo -- a small applet</li>
<ul>
<li>I played with making cubes and snowflakes with the simple notation for adding nodes and edges</li>
</ul>
<li><a target="_blank" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20021126103328/http://touchgraph.sourceforge.net/">Touchgraph</a> -- added navigation and metadata, xml datasets</li>
<ul>
<li>undertook a project to connect everybody that I knew by how they knew each other called <a target="_blank" href="http://forresto.com/oldsite/interactive/sociograph/sociograph.html">Sociograph</a> (had to stop adding nodes after a while, was getting obsessed)</li>
</ul>
<li><a target="_blank" href="http://prefuse.org/">Prefuse</a> -- improved on these concepts aesthetically, and added many new visualizations</li>
<ul>
<li>almost inspired to learn Java, but never really dove into it</li>
</ul>
<li><a target="_blank" href="http://mark-shepherd.com/blog/springgraph-flex-component/">SpringGraph</a> -- Graph layout concepts in Flex</li>
<ul>
<li>created <a target="_blank" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20021126103328/http://touchgraph.sourceforge.net/">TagGraph</a> with this and the Flickr API, which creates an almost limitless web of photos and tags in an easily explorable interface</li>
</ul>
<li><a target="_blank" href="http://flare.prefuse.org/">Flare</a> -- some of prefuse ported to ActionScript</li>
<ul>
<li>could inspire some very cool data visualization apps in the near future</li>
<li>may become the base of <a href="http://forresto.livejournal.com/165731.html">Sociograph 2.0</a></li>
<li><a href="http://flare.prefuse.org/demo/">http://flare.prefuse.org/demo/</a> -- so cool</li>
</ul>
</ol>
