<p><img alt="kiteflyer" title="kite flyer" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/374738" class="picture" align="right" />Today Genevieve asked me what was outside of my window, and there was a pheasant (or some kind of chicken-like wild bird) in the garden next to my house. I wonder if she was lost, or if maybe that's where she decided to set up nest. Hopefully we'll meet again, so I can figure out what she is.</p>
