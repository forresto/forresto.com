Sorry updates have been sparse lately.  Today was my first last visit to a school... Kadochu.  This school used to be a bit of a drag to go to, but I feel like it has turned for the better in the past couple of years.  The kids were very sweet to me today, and I made it through my first goodbye speech and song.  I should make a verse in Japanese about sucking at sayonara.</p>
