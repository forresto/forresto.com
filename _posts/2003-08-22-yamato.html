<p>i wish i could work full-time at yamato. the three:one::student:staff ratio rocks my socks. i wondered today if the students are oppressed, since there is no way that they would ever be able to get away with anything... but then i counter-wondered if being a secretly bad kid every once and a while actually benefited me growing up. not that i ever actually got away with anything as a kid.</p>
