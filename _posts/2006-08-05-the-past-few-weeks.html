<p>I've found a job, done a couple of clogging gigs, changed houses, and<br />
rehearsed with the Apple Chill Cloggers "di Carrboro" for a<br />
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20061207060547/http://trasinet.com/agilla/rassegna-en.html">folk dance<br />
review internazionale</a> in<br />
<a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=Castiglione+del+Lago,+Italia&ie=UTF8&om=1&ll=43.126186,12.053096&spn=0.007329,0.021522&t=k">Castiglione<br />
del Lago</a>, Italy (looks nice from above, doesn't it?).  Our last<br />
rehearsal was Wednesday and it went really well as we have tightened<br />
up as a team.  I did a gig with them last week which gave me a taste<br />
of being a performer on the road (the sleeping in a hotel part)...<br />
some of the cloggers I know were in full-time touring groups for six<br />
years straight back in the day.  Crazy.  I could be into it though.</p>
<p>After Italia I'll to Scotland to visit folks and the fringe fest.  I'm<br />
leaving tomorrow morning and still have to do some packing so ciao for<br />
now!</p>
