<p>I watched this movie last night in Kuji with Daniel. Joan Baez stole the show in my mind. She is such a cool presence in the film. I was left wondering why she rolled with such a cocky pretentious crowd... Bob's road manager said "look, she's wearing a see-through blouse and it is like you don't even want her to." And she just walked out of the room to let the testosterone simmer on its own. Her songs were the best of the film. <small>{Seeing a young Bob Dylan did remind me of Alex.}</small> The scene where Bob was ragging on the <em>Time</em> reporter was complete bullocks. The music was good, but the scene seemed so uptight backstage that it was ridiculous. Donovan's song was beautiful too; he seemed less pretentious and more laid back than the rest around him.</p>
