<p>Why did I even bother with getting an XBox if I don't know anything about video games? <a href="http://www.xboxmediacenter.de/">XBMC</a>.</p>
<p>But it would be nice to have some games on it, and since I was never much of a video game player, I'm seeking advice... what are your favorite video games ever?  As long as it is from the Sega Genesis / Super Nintendo / <a href="http://mameox.sourceforge.net/compat.php">pre-2000ish arcade era</a> and earlier I'm pretty sure I can find it and put it on this thing.</p>
