<p>Today I got a crash course in Buddhism and temple life... see, it was career day at Jounai and all the kids visited different jobs.  Some kids went to work with carpenters, some to the grocery store, and some to the local Buddhist temple. I'm glad I got put with that group, I feel like I learned quite a bit. Our responsibilities for the day included: setting out food and tea offerings in about 50 different places in the temple, lighting lots of incense, chanting, visiting a small plot of graves and lighting more incense, sitting through a benediction of a household shrine thing at a local family's place, doing zazen (meditation), clearing all the food offerings from the morning, cleaning the temple, and eating lots of food.</p>
<p>I also learned that one of my 7th graders is on his way to becoming a monk! What!?! And that I could be if I wanted (he said so out of the blue, impressed with my haircut I think).</p>
