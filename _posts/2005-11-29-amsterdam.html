<p><font size="2">(I took my film camera, and have yet to get the pictures developed, but I'll scan and flickr them as soon as I do. There should be some good ones in there.)</font></p>
<p>I was going to hang out and travel in Europe over the holidays, but my folks (easily) talked me into coming home for Christmas and Winter Dance Week. Since I wasn't going to travel at the end of school, I decided to take a little time off of school to go somewhere new. A friend of mine had told me that she was going to be in Amsterdam, I figured out that I could get there easily enough by train, and bought a Eurail pass, all in one night. After all, it was going to be my last chance in the foreseeable future to be in that city of my friends' legends.</p>
<p>I packed light, realizing how nice it was to have NIH as base camp. For some reason the DSB website had told me to go one-hundred kilometers south past Hamburg, then wait for a train back to Hamburg before connecting to Holland. Luckily I realized how dumb that would be, and saved about four hours when compared to the computer itinerary. It was dark when I arrived in Amsterdam, and as I soon learned, that city gets a little crazy after dark. I wondered down a street, in a direction that I thought might be towards my hostel. After walking a block, I stopped at a corner to look around, and immediately a man asked if I need help finding anything. Dutch people sure are friendly.</p>
<p>“No,” I replied, “I'm just looking around.”<br />“No, where are you headed? I can show you the way.”</p>
<p>Isn't that nice of him, I thought. He sure is trying to be helpful.</p>
<p>“No thanks, just checking the scene out,” I said.<br />“When did you get here?”<br />“Just got off the train,” I said, motioning to the backpack on my back.<br />“Where you from man?”<br />“USA, but I'm living in Denmark now.”<br />“Looking for something to smoke?”<br />“No, not really.”<br />“I know where you can find some good stuff.”</p>
<p>(Well, so does everybody else on earth that has even heard of Amsterdam. If I had been looking for something to smoke, I imagined it would have been easy enough to pop into any of the three coffeeshops within sight...)</p>
<p>“Looking for a good time with a girl? Coke? Speed? X?” came the rapid-fire response to my ellipses.<br />“Uhm, no,” I said (thinking no, no, no, and hell no).</p>
<p>He didn't give up, and seemed the only way out of the conversation-turned-pleading-accusing-begging-hustle was to walk away saying “no thanks.” He followed for a bit, offering to show me the places the tourists don't see (I'd rather see the Van Gogh Museum, thanks) and dropping bits of advice like “don't smoke anything they give you in a pipe on the street because you'll wake up with no shoes.” I guess I took that advice to heart, because I didn't smoke anything given to me on the street the whole time I was there. I sure can't wait to get back home to my sheltered life where smoking random s#!t from the street is a rational thing to do. He gave up after a bit, once I had stopped acknowledging his existence.</p>
<p>“Hey buddy, got a light?” asked someone walking the other way.<br />“Yeah sure,” I said, still distracted by the the strangeness of the last conversation. I'd never seen a panhandler be so insistent. I fished the lighter from adventure class from my jacket pocket and handed it to him.<br />“So... what you smoke with that lighter? Pot? Hash? Got any pot? Need any pot? Need any hash? I know where you can get the good stuff. Can you spare some change?” he spurted.</p>
<p>Even though this guy obviously needed to work on his timing, he did get the “most blatant lie to bait a tourist into listening” award. It didn't take long for me to realize that basically every person that talks to you in Amsterdam has got some hustle.</p>
<p>Somehow I was lucky enough to walk straight to the hostel without even looking at a map. Helen wasn't going to get to town for another couple of days, so it was probably the first time for me to be in a city knowing no one.</p>
<p>I wasn't sure how much Japanese I had forgotten in my time in Denmark, but my confidence had been restored in the train when I talked to a guy for three hours in Japanese. He was a vintage clothes dealer, which seems to be a popular occupation for young Japanese people that want to see the world. At the hostel that night I struck up a conversation with another Japanese guy who was talking to a Korean girl in Japanese. After awhile another Japanese girl joined us. It was cool to get back into the shaberi-flow, and they were a metcha-friendly bunch of folks, if a bit naïve about their surroundings. (“We like Amsterdam, but we don't like drugs, and coffeeshops are stinky...”)</p>
<p>Wednesday I decided use one of the extra days on my train pass to go to Brussels. I didn't know much about the place, but I've always wanted to see the European parliament and figured the city would be entertaining enough for the day. I was surprised how busted that city seemed to be. Central Station's lights didn't work, I had to use my keychain flashlight to find what time to catch the return train. There seemed to be major demolition and construction on every block. Besides the broken parts, it seemed like a pretty cool town. I got to see Parliament, St. Micheal's cathedral, and a couple of cool museums in my time there.</p>
<p>That night, back in Amsterdam, I went out to find food, and found the best pizza ever. On the way back to the hostel, a guy approached me with a map.</p>
<p>“Excuse me, do you know where Dam is?” he asked, looking perplexedly at his map.<br />“Nope,” I lied, not missing a beat or slowing down. Being the seasoned Amsterdam traveler of two days, hearing this, I had heard it all. There was no way I was going to get sucked into another drawn-out hustle. I felt bad when I glanced back though, because he was going back to his friends, still looking at the map. I think they actually were lost.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I met up with my friends, saw the Van Gogh museum, met two cool bros from Mallorca, saw some hot Spanish hiphop, and dodged hustlers for the rest of the week. Good times.</p>
