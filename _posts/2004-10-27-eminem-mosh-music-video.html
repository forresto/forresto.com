Eminem - Mosh</a></center><br />
(<a href="https://archive.org/details/Mosh">alt link</a>, <a href="http://66.90.75.92/suprnova//torrents/2878/Eminem_Mosh_bb2-mov.torrent">.mov.torrent</a>) -- i watched it this morning, and was fairly impressed with the animation... the song is good if you ignore the self-imporance, but the video is better. tho a little late... but who knows? maybe the timing is perfect.</p>
