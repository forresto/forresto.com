I decided to do it in the lobby of a huge hotel. Anyhow, I tripped on the carpet runner at the top of the stairs and slid down and down and down--I think there were 600 steps--pulling the runner with me. As I slid I closed my eyes. At the bottom of the steps, the staff of the hotel advanced towards me. <b>Later.</b> Standing in an entryway with a group of foreigners. A girl that I know well tells me that she really liked my movie. <i>"But I made it in a dream... this is my dream!"</i> I insist, but she just laughs me off. "Fine, I'll just tell you next time I see you when we are both awake. Then you'll know." <b>Then.</b> I am on a bridge looking across the water at the city, and realize that I need to be awake and heading to work. I succeed in waking myself <i>from the dream</i> by inhaling my chewing gum. <b>The problem.</b> So I'm awake now for real, but this girl... who was she? I have no clue. I'm sure that I have never seen or met this person. Same thing a few nights ago, I dreamt that I was at the folk school, and everybody (four people, including my own mother) telling me that I should marry this girl (her name was either Peach or Ginger). In the dream I had known her my whole life (well, her whole life, she was a few years younger than I). I had never thought of her that way, but everybody pushing me that way made me really want something to work. In reality... this person does not exist, <i>as far as I know</i>.</p>
