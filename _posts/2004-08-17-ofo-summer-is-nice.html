<p>Sorry, long time no update...</p>
<p>Back in June my Mom, Dad and Sister came over to Iwate for a couple of<br />
weeks.  We visited my schools and traveled around the prefecture.  One of<br />
my favorite parts of having them here was to hear their analysis of what<br />
was going on around us.  When I arrived in Taneichi there were a few<br />
things new to me, but overall nothing was too shocking, since I had "done"<br />
Japan before.  This was my parents' second visit to Japan, and my sister's<br />
first, so they were able to point out things that I have come to take as<br />
normal.  Let's hear what they have to say about the visit, in their own<br />
words...</p>

then click the right arrow to read each entry on Japan.</p>
<p>There is a lot that has happened since their visit.  A bunch of friends<br />
left, and some new ones have been found.  I volunteered at the Jazz fest<br />
that I loved so much last year, and had a great time.  I've been in the<br />
ocean almost every day, as Summer has been almost perfect.  Now the Fall<br />
winds are blowing, so it's about time to get out the full wetsuit and<br />
booties once again.  Tonight I have a date with a ukulele player from<br />
Sendai at Tomaya.  This weekend I'm taking a little time off to go see the<br />
Kodo Taiko Ensemble on Sado Island, who are apparently the stuff.  As I<br />
cruise into my second year, Iwate continues to keep it interesting.</p>
