<p>Daniel (<a href="http://el_danimal.livejournal.com/" class="lj-user">el_danimal</a>) woke me up this morning, singing "good morning sunshine." Luckily he didn't pull the covers, or he would have gotten more than he had bargained for.... He was in town returning his car to the rental place and dropping off some stuff at Mike's place. I made him some Ghiradelli Johnny Cakes and we chewed the fat like we always do. He's on his way to China with <a href="http://www.110am.com/">Tom</a>, but he'll be back in a couple of weeks, so it's not the last goodbye.</p>
<p>But now I'm thinking about my friends that are leaving for new adventures, and getting kinda jealous again. Not that anything is wrong with my life, but I haven't lived in one place for two years since middle school (if you count big trips). Well, going home for a month did break it up, and I'll definitely have to leave this winter as well.</p>
<p>So yeah, fare thee well all you leavers, hope you have some good adventures, and stay in touch!</p>
