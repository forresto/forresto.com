<p>Squeeze my eyes open, fighting jet lag and sleep off my back. The flat is quiet, nobody is here. They have all gone. To class? Which is starting.</p>
<p>Right now.</p>
<p>Crap.</p>
<p>Its 9:05am, and somehow I have slept through everybody’s alarms and bustling about and leaving. In addition, they have all forgotten me as well, it seems. Not that it is their responsibility to wake me up in the morning, but come on guys! I make it to the study centre by 9:30, and apologize to Hap and the fourteen other member of the program. After class I apologize to Hap again, and he seems understanding. It won’t happen again, because I make a pact with the flatmates.</p>
<p>Jeez, first day and I’m late to the first class. Why does this seem so familiar? Could I have called it? Well, yes I probably could have called it, since I manage to reenact this scene in some form or another every semester. PAYce.</p>
