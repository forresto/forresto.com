<p>I got a message on my machine last night with some weirdo just rambling... "Mayonnaise, monkeys, a dolphin, pocket lint..."  He went on like that for a few minutes, and then said "call be back muth*f*aa, paaaayce," leaving no name.</p>
<p>I traced the call (ok, not much of a challenge) to <a href="http://meemoouprising.livejournal.com/" class="lj-user">meemoouprising</a> and called him back this morning. He's getting married. I knew this before, but they have a date now. I really hope I can go the wedding, I think it will be a proper reunion. Best of luck to the happy couple in planning this thing, and even more luck to all of us that are thrown into an existential / quarter-life crisis thinking about it. Married. Wow.</p>
