<p>I've had this concept in my head for awhile now....  now that it's done I realize you can't readily tell time on it, because the faces rotate in relation to their parent faces.  So now I consider it a time-sculpture without practical use.  But maybe one could get used to it...<br />

Can you figure out the date and time represented in the above capture?</p>
