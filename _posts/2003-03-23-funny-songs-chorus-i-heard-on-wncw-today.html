<p>Counting flowers on the wall, That don't bother me at all.<br />
Playing Solitaire till dawn, With a deck of fifty-one.<br />
Smoking cigarettes and watching Captain Kangaroo.<br />
Now, don't tell me I've nothing to do.</p>
<p>I went to the Little River dance last night, didn't dance them all b/c my neck and back and shoulders were hurting, but they feel better now, and the dancing I did helped heal.</p>
