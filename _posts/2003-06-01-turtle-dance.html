<p>I have an origami turtle that lives on the top of my dresser. I came home today from the Weaverville dance, and he had fallen off, but caught himself on the edge of the top drawer. I don't know how long he held himself there by one foot, but I imagine he was relieved when I righted him.</p>
<p>The Bristol / Weaverville / Hendersonville contention played point after the dance, then sat around and talked... It feels good to meet and know good people. I hope the folks are not mad for us being late.</p>
<p>I'm scheming.</p>
