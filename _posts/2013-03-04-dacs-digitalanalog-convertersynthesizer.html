<p>I've been in NYC for a few days to interact directly with Eyebeam and Mozilla people to talk about future plans and potentials for Meemoo.org. From Thursday to Saturday was <a href="http://www.arthackday.net/god_mode/">Art Hack Day</a> at 319 Scholes in Brooklyn.</p>
<p>This diagram shows a concept that has been in my mind for one way to conceptualize the project: a frictionless digital/analog converter/synthesizer.</p>

<p><em>(Edit 10/01: I realized that the <a href="http://www.forresto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Digital-Analog-diagram.png">old version</a> of the diagram wasn't really what I was thinking.)</em></p>
<p>The idea is that any of these should be easily mashed together to experiment with aesthetic possibilities. WebGL textures projected on clay forms, paper puppets animated with your voice, finger-paint textures on 3D graphics... This concept is extremely broad, and I still need to find ways to narrow the focus on a few easy activities that can introduce newbies to the toolset. I'm making a collection of "hack-tivities" as I come up with them.</p>
<p>We made this animated font in a rainy-day workshop. I snuck in some easy HTML hacking so that anybody can mix the letters into messages:<br />

<p>These "physical gif" animated images are now easy to make with Meemoo:<br />

<p>I'll be making more of these introductory pathways to Meemoo as the project progresses.</p>
