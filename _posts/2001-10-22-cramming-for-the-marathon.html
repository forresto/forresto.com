<p>Yesh, I discovered today that training for a marathon <u>should not</u> be done in the same manner that I study for tests. I have been jogging semi-regularly, but the spirit moved me to go for the half (or maybe just 11 miles, not sure) today. At two hours I was on campus, and thought that a good finale would be to go to weaver street and back... I felt good leaving, but once I got to the weav I died. My body (the boss, it knows best, of course) threatened to turn insideout if I were to take a single more running step.</p>
<p>I don't know what this means for thankgiving day, will I be able to do that twice??? We shall see.</p>
