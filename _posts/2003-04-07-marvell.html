<p>It's the birthday of English poet Andrew Marvell, born at Winestead-in-Holderness, Yorkshire, England (1621). His best known poem is "To His Coy Mistress" (1650):</p>
<p><em>Had we but world enough and time,<br />
This coyness, Lady, were no crime...<br />
But at my back I always hear<br />
Time's winged chariot hurrying near:<br />
And yonder all before us lie<br />
Deserts of vast eternity.</em></p>
