<p>If there is anything better than teaching folk dances to a gaggle of elementary kids jacked-up on sugar, I wouldn't know what it is.  I went surfing at Kanehama before that too, and I think I actually got into the good part of a couple of waves.  The speed and touching the smooth part of the wave is incredible, too hard to describe.</p>
