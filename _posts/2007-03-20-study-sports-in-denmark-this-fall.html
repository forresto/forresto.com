<p>The director of <a href="http://nih.dk/">Nordjyllands Idrætshøjskole</a>, the folk school <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/forresto/collections/72157600005258392/">I attended in 2005</a>, has asked me to recommend a couple of people for scholarships to study there this Fall.  The semester included a trip to Chamonix, France for glacier and rock climbing, rafting, mountain biking, and more, as well as a ski trip to Lillehammer, Norway.  In addition to these school-sponsored trips, NIH was a great home base to explore Scandinavia on long weekends.</p>
<p>One of the most intense and gratifying experiences of my life was the school-wide <a href="http://forresto.livejournal.com/149732.html">24 hour adventure race</a>, which included canoeing, biking, running, skating, climbing, problem solving, and very little sleep.  Sound fun to you?</p>

The students were age 18 to 30ish.</p>

<ul>
<li>Adventure (biking, skiing, climbing, rappelling)</li>
<li>Aerobics</li>
<li>Badminton</li>
<li>Dance</li>
<li>Fodbold (soccer)</li>
<li>Floorball (hockey in tennis shoes)</li>
<li>Håndbold (somewhere between indoor soccer + basketball,  big in Scandinavia and Korea.)</li>
<li>Powersport</li>
<li>Spinning</li>
<li>Volleyball</li>
</ul>
