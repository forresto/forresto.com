<p>There is a girl who I consider a sister, and we are going to meet her friends at their apartment, in NYC.  There were parts of the stairway that were about 2'x4', which made it quite difficult, especially with laundry racks and laundry hanging everywhere.  Once we got into the apartment it was quite roomy though.  I went down to a big picture window with an amazing view of the city, and walked outside to a big grassy hill.  She and I walked down, and she told me she was going to get a sex change the next day, and I said I was really proud of her, and I'd have to get used to thinking of her as a little brother instead of sister.  We went swimming in a big river, and it was really too green and lush to be NYC.  I was wishing that I had brought my camera to take a long-exposure photo of the white water.</p>
