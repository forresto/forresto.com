<p>I don't get how <a href="http://blog.deanforamerica.com/archives/000408.html">they can be so positive</a>. I guess it is some strange personality trait that politicians have... glutton for punishment... I've never run for anything higher than treasurer of a high school club. I am proud of holding that post, though, so maybe that is how the bug gets planted.</p>
<p>And the people that surround them! They devote thier entire lives for some amount of time to building them up, then most of them have to deal with seeing thier icons get knocked back down... What could make somebody want to do that???</p>
