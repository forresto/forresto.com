<p>December 17, 2005<br />I'm in a train now to Hamburg now with<br />
the memories of the past five months flashing around me.  Another<br />
chapter abroad has come to a close.  The past three weeks have been<br />
especially full, with the International Class' trip to Copenhagen,<br />
friends' weekend at the school, my <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/forresto/151542.html">trip to Amsterdam</a>, the Adventure<br />
Team's ski trip to Lillehammer, parents' weekend, the last week of<br />
school, and the voyage home...</p>
