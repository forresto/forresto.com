<p><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20130216024556/http://www.capitolhillblue.com/artman/publish/article_4636.shtml">This article</a> is pretty obliquely slanted, but if the following is true then it's worth a laugh:<br />
<blockquote>God may also be the reason Attorney General John Ashcroft, the administration's lightning rod because of his questionable actions that critics argue threatens freedoms granted by the Constitution, remains part of the power elite. <strong>West Wing staffers call Bush and Ashcroft "the Blues Brothers" because "they're on a mission from God."</strong></p></blockquote>
