<p>The room in which we have class is hermetically sealed, but luckily the first speaker here has set the precedent of having more breaks in each day of class. The University building is amazing... It is nicer than most malls, I think. There are huge vaulted glass ceilings that can be opened when the weather is nice, and man oh man has the weather been nice. The place seems pretty abandoned in the summer, though. </p>
<p>Downtown there are signs that say: <i>"Trondheim: 997-1997"</i> ... They celebrated their millenial five years ago. Wow</p>
