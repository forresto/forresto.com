<p><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050712082233/http://www.harpers.org/TheCubaDiet.html">The Cuba Diet</a>, by Bill McKibben (on <a href="http://harpers.org/">harpers.org</a>)</p>
<blockquote><p>
There’s always at least the possibility, however, that larger sections<br />
of the world might be in for “Special Periods” of their own. Climate<br />
change, or the end of cheap oil, or the depletion of irrigation water,<br />
or the chaos of really widespread terrorism, or some other malign force<br />
might begin to make us pay more attention to the absolute bottom-line<br />
question of how we get our dinner (a question that only a very few<br />
people, for a very short period of time, have ever been able to<br />
ignore). No one’s predicting a collapse like the one Cuba<br />
endured—probably no modern economy has ever undergone such a shock. But<br />
if things got gradually harder? After all, our planet is an island,<br />
too. It’s somehow useful to know that someone has already run the<br />
experiment.</p></blockquote>
<p>
This is highly recommended reading for anybody interested in Cuba,<br />
sustainable agriculture, &amp;/or the impact of the global<br />
economy on our food, environment, and health. Basically, Cuba bought into the idea that machines will<br />
be the salvation of the working class, but the Soviet-backed<br />
machine-based agriculture system was ridiculously unsustainable.<br />
The collapse of the Soviet Union and the US-backed embargo left Cuba<br />
with no fuel or spare parts for the tractors, and no way to feed its citizens. They had no choice<br />
but to go sustainable (it was either that or "lay down and cry.")<br />
This article speculates what might happen if and when the embargo is<br />
lifted or Castro dies. It nudges towards the conclusion that food<br />
production in the US could learn from Cuba: "Is it possible that<br />
markets, at least for food, may work better when they’re smaller and<br />
more isolated?"</p>
