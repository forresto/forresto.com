<p>I was in a house full of Canadians, some were speaking French. Thing was, somehow my mind generated at least 30 very convincing Canadians based only on my stereotypes. I had conversations with them, they were making fun of some authority figure, I was asking them about moving to Canada... and it was all quite convincing. I don't even know that many Canadians.</p>
