<p>I had two banjo gigs for the <a href="http://www.canecreekcloggers.org/">cloggers</a> lasterday, in the morning at VGCC's cultural fair, and in the evening at Habitat's square dance benefit on campus.  I also played for the dance with <i>The Pickup Ramblers</i>, which was good fun.  Jaso called and gets mad props for his multivocalism antics in the walkthroughs.</p>
<p>Post-square dance Peter and I decided to busk for the Franklin Street collegiate drunkards, and made $4 in the fifteen minutes before our hands got cold, which, I realized, is more income than I've made since moving here on February 1st.  Today I did get a small contract teaching Dreamweaver and Flash classes at the <a href="http://www.artscenterlive.org/">ArtCenter</a> in Carrboro.</p>
<p>That's not until the summer, and I need to pay some billz now, so if you or your organization are looking for a blog, portal, storefront, podcast, and/or static site you should hire me.  Friend rates and friendly rates apply, hosting and everything included.  Check out <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060703165101/http://sembiki.com/">my portfolio</a> and drop me a line.</p>
