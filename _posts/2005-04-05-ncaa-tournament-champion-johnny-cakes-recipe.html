<p>(Johnny cakes are Carribbean cornbread-biscuit-pancake things. I made these in honor of <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050504075603/http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/gameupdate?gameId=254000063">The Heel's harrowing victory over Illinois</a> over my lunchbreak today. That and I had leftover batter from breakfast.)</p>
<p>Sift the dry stuff together:<br />
1 cup whole wheat flour<br />
1 cup corn meal<br />
2 or 3 tbsp sugar<br />
1 tsp salt<br />
1 tsp baking powder</p>
<p>Mix the wet stuff separately:<br />
1 cup water<br />
1 egg<br />
2 tbsp oil</p>
<p>Pour the wet into the dry and stir just enough to mix, don't overdo it or you'll kill the baking powder.  Put biscuit-sized blobs on a dry pan over medium heat.  Flip, serve, eat, mmm.  I added walnuts.</p>
