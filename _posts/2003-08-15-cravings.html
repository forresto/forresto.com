<p>sometimes i want to eat something so badly that i can feel my teeth sinking into it... like a big, fat, natural peanut butter sandwich on whole wheat bread... or cosmic cantina fresh salsa and tortilla chips. i don't think about it, i just feel it, and the feeling takes me by surprise. man on man.</p>
