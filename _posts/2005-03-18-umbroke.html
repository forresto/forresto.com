<p>Are you OK?</p>
<p>The reason I ask is that your umbrella broke in my hand today... it was shocking; I was shocked.  The shaft broke where the release latchbutton is, and the handle is no longer.  All I did was twist and shake it like always to deraindrop it.  This on the first rainy day. The rain smells really good.</p>
<p>So I'm making sure you are OK, and not connected to the orangebrella like ET or a voodoo doll.  Still have your handle?</p>
<p>Thanks for the memories,<br />
