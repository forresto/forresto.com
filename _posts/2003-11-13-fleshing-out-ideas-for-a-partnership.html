<p>I'm excited about this possibility... hopefully they will say yes,,, and I bet they will. The problem with <a href="http://folktunes.org">folktunes.org</a> is that it is a chicken/egg thing: it needs content before people will use it, and people need to use it before they consider contributing to it. But once the ball starts rolling, it should be good. Exciting!</p>
<p>I'm also groovin now to some <a href="http://archive.org/audio/audiolisting-browse.php?cat=326">public domain tunes</a> recorded in the late 20's.</p>

<p>Dear <a href="http://archive.org">archive.org</a>,</p>
<p>My name is Forrest Oliphant, and I'm starting work on folktunes.org, the<br />
"Folk Tunes Archive for Teaching and Learning." The purpose of this<br />
collection is to collect and make available different renditions of<br />
public-domain folk music. Folk music is unique in that often you<br />
attribute the style in which you play to whomever taught you the song,<br />
rather than a specific copyright holder. The ideal setting for learning<br />
tunes is in a live, one-on-one session with a friend or acquaintance.<br />
However, folktunes.org and archive.org have the potential to give an<br />
alternative for when this is not possible.</p>
<p>The best way that I see this happening is for folktunes.org to become a<br />
"collection" of its own under "<a href="http://archive.org/mediatypes-browse.php?mediatype=audio">Top Level > Audio</a>." I have some questions<br />
as to how these collections are managed, but those can come later.</p>
<p>Folktunes.org is and will remain hosted by <a href="http://ibiblio.org/">Ibiblio</a>. It will become an<br />
information frontpage for how to contribute to and use the recordings<br />
hosted on archive.org. The original plan was for ibiblio to host the<br />
audio files as well, but it seems archive.org is better suited for this.</p>
<p>I feel that this will be a good partnership, if we decide to go forward<br />
from here. What is the next step at this point?</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
