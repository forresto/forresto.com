<p>Turns<br />
out my thesis is due nest Tuesday the 19th. I have to defend it in front<br />
of the commitee, which might be intimidating but probably not. I actually<br />
got an OK amount done on it today, though, so I guess I'll make it. Wednesday<br />
must be 110 percent as productive as today if finished it shall be. And it<br />
shall be.</p>
<p>I need sleep like the M'Fo I am.</p>
