<p>Thrusted myself into social situations to keep from thinking too much, but Cate wanted to know all the details... Wanted to sigh myself inside out, which made chewing stromboli interesting. Went to movie night (forget which film... some help?), and ended up speaking to <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/discolemonade">Liz</a> for hours.</p>
<p>Didn't crash until 5am, actually. Figured out that she knows of the <a href="http://www.folkschool.org">folk school</a>, futhermore went to little / middle folk school summer camp, furthermore same years as me... gets interesting... I remembered this superduperkicka$s puff-paint shirt that said "lizard breath" that her uncle had given her... remember thinking she was way cool. I met Liz(ard breath) about a year ago at a Blue Rags show,,, I asked her to dance in a rare spout of bravery,,, & we were in the <b>same freaking summercamp group</b>. We are talking 4th grade here.</p>
<p>Well, I thought it was cool.</p>
<p>btw, we came to 0 conclusions about the pain/love conundrum, but it felt damn good to talk it out</p>
