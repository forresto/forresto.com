<p>Today <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2012/12/05/openart/">Mozilla</a> and <a href="http://www.eyebeam.org/blogs/paul/announcing-the-2013-openart-fellows">Eyebeam</a> are announcing the Open(Art) 2013 fellows, and I'm one of them! :-D<br />
I'll be using this opportunity to expand the capabilities of <a href="http://meemoo.org/">Meemoo</a> and extend it into an open source web art community.</p>
<p><em>Coder analogy:</em> Meemoo is a dataflow framework, where apps are made by connecting modules which encapsulate functionality like visual effects. The output of the apps could be a generative animation, stop-motion GIF, web cam effect, or (in the future) audio composition. These apps can be built, shared, and forked without leaving the browser.</p>
<p><em>Artist analogy:</em> The community will be like a game of exquisite corpse, where the rules of the game as well as the media can be transformed with each step.</p>
<p>Input welcome!</p>
