<p>I'm looking for my (first non-phone) digital camera now, and I've narrowed it down to <a href="http://i4u.shopping.com/xSBS-cameras_and_photography_digital_cameras--sd_card-at_least_3_0_megapixels-vga___640_x_480-%255Empeg%25964~P-1~V-~PRDLT-24883420-27560251-24883419-25341497-23722590~PG-2">these five</a> (Kodak EasyShare V530, Kodak EasyShare V550, Samsung Digimax L50, Casio Exilim EX-S500, Casio Exilim EX-Z750).  Does anybody have any recommendations for or against those or for a different one like those?  I guess I want something that's ~$200-350, &gt;3MP, SD media, decent video, and pocketable.</p>
