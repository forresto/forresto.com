<p>This morning I dreamed I was driving in the countryside. I came upon an monument that had changed from a dome to a spire, but the spire had disappeared leaving only the decorative cap. It was about 30 ft in diameter. I drove right up to it and started yelling to it out my window.</p>
<p>"So where have you been, Mr. Decorative spire cap??? You never call me. Some friend you are," and I went on like this.</p>
<p>The Japanese tour guide got mad at me. "Please do not use a loud voice in our house," she admonished. I pulled away, my work there was done, but the Chinese tour guide started to defend my bizarre actions.</p>
<p>"It is a special kind of comedy. It is considered quite funny."</p>
<p>I didn't care anymore, so I sped off. I forgot the way out, there were many gravel roads in many directions. Chances are, the one I chose was not the right one. I didn't care, tho. Suddenly, there was a low wall across my road. I slammed on my breaks and stopped a few inches from it. I could see tiny writing all over it, like the Declaration of Independence.</p>
