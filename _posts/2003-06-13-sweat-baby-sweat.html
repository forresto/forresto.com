<p>There was a whole lotta perspiring goin on. I was dripping from everywhere. Spin swing and gypsy... movement connections and beauty. The first dance of the evening was <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&q=%22jefferson+and+liberty%22+dance&btnG=Google+Search">one written for Thomas Jefferson</a>. Being old, it has lots of time to goof around between the moves, so I had a blast doing it.</p>
