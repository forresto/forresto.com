<p>After spending a week at the Monastary of Taizé partying with a bunch of crazy Germans until 2 am every night (8 PM your time) and spending the day thinking of home we hopped on a bus and then a few trains and ended up in Finale Ligure Italy. We spent two nights there and finally the sun came out. The water is so incredibly clear it looks fake. Then I spent the rest of the day collecting beach glass. Every store, restaurant and street vendor here has got some type of dance music blaring. I miss home. Now we are in Florence, just being tourists. Hanging out at the youth hostel is pretty cool. Until I write again, Ciao</p>
