# Why has anarchy had such bad PR?

Prof. Ruth Kinna:

> I think it’s partly because of the ways in which anarchists expressed their critique.

> But the people that they most upset were those that they had something in common with. And they were talking really to republicans and liberals who they accused of failing to deliver on revolutionary goals.  So the standard historic goals of equality, liberty, fraternity. And what they were saying was that, y’know, if you’re serious about those goals then you can’t organise in the way that you’re organising, you can’t defend the constitutions that you’ve set up. Because fundamentally what those constitutions do is structure inequality and bring enmity between people by protecting their right to private property. And as long as you use the law to uphold that relationship you’re forever going to have masters and slaves.
> 
> And you can’t tell me as a liberal or a republican that you’ve abolished slavery, that you abhor that kind of relationship, but actually what you’ve done in your constitution is that you’ve formally abolished the ownership of people. But you’ve now put most people in a relationship of enslavement by forcing them to work for others on the owner’s terms.
> 
> It suggests that everything that the liberal or the republican state defends in terms of rights was a fiction and not only that compared to other socialists, the anarchists refused to contemplate entering into these systems in order to change them because they believed that the systems themselves were inevitably corrupting.  Unlike social democrats, unlike other socialists, they refused to think in terms of organising political parties and they always advocated direct action. And as soon as you put yourself outside of the systems and you say:
> 1. I’m going to fight your systems because I think they’re wrong
> 2. I’m going to expose the values that you hold dear as being false
> 3. And I’m going to fight you by methods that you don’t approve of.
> 
> It’s perhaps not surprising that anarchists get a bad name, it’s easy to demonise them as irrational, they look like they’re outlaws, they look like they just want to destroy. Anarchist have been demonized as outlaws and criminals and people who need to be dealt with with repressive force.
