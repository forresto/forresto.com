<p>Guess what? I was just veiled in fresh air with fine-grained lather and subtle fragrance. And I wouldn't have even known if I didn't read the soap container. My gosh(!) how I enjoy the new bath time. Hey there! I guess it has been awhile since I last wrote a big ol' thing. What is this now? 12? Alrighty... Issue 12, here we come...</p>
<p>Yesterday was my last full day of school, and the third graders graduated on Wednesday. It was quite sad to have to say goodbye to them all... I also made a couple of friends in the 3rd grade as I was saying my omedetou s and baibaai s to old friends. I also made my peace with a girl I called scary before. Not that she became any less scary...</p>
<p>The setsugyoshiki was a lot like my graduation ceremony back home, except that only one person from each homeroom class went onto the stage to receive a certificate. Good thing, too... in order to get it there was a large series of bows (the whole 45 degrees, too), and the principal read the whole paper. Another difference between Shisho and HHS was the lack of screaming and hooting after each name.</p>
<p>Another difference (not to exploit differences as something to write about or anything), don't you hate it when you lose a sentence? It snowed about three weeks ago... the first time Hiroshima has gotten more than 10cm in the past 4 years. 14cm fell that night, most on my back as I was outside making a snowman. Apparently nobody else was as excited as me about the snow, I was the only one in the out in the neighborhood. The snow was a thick silencing blanket over the city. The house is close to two major roads... giving the area constant noise. But I guess it is the type of noise that you only notice once it is gone. And it was gone. Dead quiet in the dead of the city... I think I was out for two hours at least, making a large snow creature. The host parents insisted that I come inside, saying "kaze hitoru yo!"</p>
<p>The only photo that I got of my work was from the next morning. The wind had decapitated her, and the weight of his head broke its blue bucket hat, as well. But you can see the beast the next morning, as well as more snow pictures, at http://briefcase.yahoo.com/phuzo</p>
<p>That's all for now, see ya next time, love,<br />
