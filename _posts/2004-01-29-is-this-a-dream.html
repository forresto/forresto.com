<p>Back-story: I got lost on the way to something and gave up; this was my reward. I don't watch much anime (I have only seen <em>Princess Mononoke</em> and <em>Spirited Away</em>), but I really felt like I had been thrust into a world not unlike that. I was sure the snow-capped minibuses and cars piled all over eachother all inbetween the trees would stretch out and yawn, then offer to take me somewhere... else.</p>
<p>Proposition: as much room and board as you can handle to come to Japan and help me shoot a movie here one snowy night. Square-format, like these thumbnails. Lit exclusively by car headlights. Deal?</p>
