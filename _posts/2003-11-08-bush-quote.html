<p>That's it... I have read this <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/views03/1107-02.htm">quoted</a> so many times lately I thought I'd just put it out there myself:<br />
<blockquote>I firmly believed that we should not march into Baghdad....To occupy Iraq would instantly shatter our coalition, turning the whole Arab world against us and make a broken tyrant into a latter day Arab hero...assigning young soldiers to a fruitless hunt for a securely entrenched dictator and condemning them to fight in what would be an unwinnable urban guerrilla war. </p></blockquote>
<p><i>- Former President George Herbert Walker Bush, in his book, "A World Transformed"</i></p>
