When I heard that it offers, as standard, 1GB of storage (that's right--1024MB--UNC times 51, Yahoo times 171, Hotmail times 512) and has nifty threading features I wanted to give it a try... so I got in by <a href="http://www.feedster.com/search.php?hl=en&ie=UTF-8&q=gmail invite?&btnG=Search&sort=date">searching feedster</a> for invite offers.  I'm convinced that just about everybody will be using this when it goes public.  I mean, everybody used Yahoo for search back in the day, but when something better came along people switched. Similarly, Yahoo Mail can't hold a torch to what GMail will offer, and most folks won't have reservations about converting over--especially when their quota is filled <em>again</em>. Also, "to yahoo" never became a verb like "to google" did.</p>
<p>I conclusion, since this is pretty cool I might consider forgiving them for changing their front page's design a few weeks ago.<br />

Edit: Now that I've had the chance to use GMail for a few emails today I am even more impressed.  I liked Mozilla Mail, but it had never really broken free of the Outlook user interface paradigm.  GMail is by far the best webmail ever, and could be the best email client, period.  As I wrote to <a href="http://110am.com/">Tom</a>, I don't even care how nerdy gushing over webmail sounds, that's how nice it is.</p>
