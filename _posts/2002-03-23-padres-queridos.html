<p>I am on lunch break now from an all-day shoot for a short film for class. We are using actual film, so we have to design the lighting and everything... its so awesome. I'm really gushing now, I love this stuff.</p>
<p>Last night went to the contra dance, and guess who was playing the guitar with the big 'ol beard and plenty of bs stories to go around...? It was John Devine. I introduced him to "the band" after the dance and we all whooped it up for awhile, it was a blast.</p>
<p>soo...</p>
<p>loveya bye</p>
