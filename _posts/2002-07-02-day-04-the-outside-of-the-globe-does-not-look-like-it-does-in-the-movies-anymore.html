<p>Today I make it to class ON TIME. Sooo proud; give self pat on back, etc. Today’s special thing is a trip to the Globe Theatre to see Shakespeare’s <i>Twelfth Night</i>. We are supposed to meet at the Globe at 7:15; the show starts at 7:30.</p>
<p>We leave the flat at the same time, but get split up before reaching the tube station. I take the stairs instead of the lift, ignoring the “175 Stairs” sign, not really realizing that it is a warning. I had no idea it was so deep. Guess I’m still used to Hiroshima’s Astram Line monorail, which is about 30 feet above the city; London’s tube is much deeper than 30 feet, at least at this station.</p>
<p>Go to the London Bridge station, but it had fallen down, so I go the next stop. The map makes it seem straightforward to walk along the river to the Globe. In practice, however, I don’t even know which way the Thames is once I emerge from the underground. I try the walking downhill method, which leads me to a sign after four minutes pointing the opposite direction for the river. Hmm. Trek through alleyways and shopping cent<i>re</i>s and finally find a path next to the river, and signs pointing to the Globe. I’m the last group member (doh) to make it but the show has not yet started. Rain has started though, and seeing as how we are groudlings we will have to deal with it.</p>
<p>If you have seen <i>Shakespeare in Love</i> you know about the setup of the Globe. The cheapest tickets were for the ground level, which is not afforded protection from the elements. I squeeze in under the roof for the first half of the show.</p>
<p>Interestingly this running has gone back to the old-school method of an all-male cast. This is quite challenging for this play, because there is one male actor playing a female character who is pretending to be a male. I was apprehensive at first, afraid that the portrayals would be demeaning to women, that the actors would slip into prissy slapstick without regard to “true” femininity. They didn’t, however, and I was impressed with their sensitive, realistic performances. The show was great, and I am really glad that I was one of the four of our program that braved the rain for the end.</p>
<p>Several of the lines in the play had the groundlings in stitches, especially when they waxed poetic about the beautiful sun. The actors took it all in stride. The finale was fitting, though: a song about the wind and rain.</p>
<p>PS: Just kidding about London Bridge Station.</p>
