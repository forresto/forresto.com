<p>16mm black and white film. Concept by me. Starring Cari Moskow. Cinematography by Meg Barnhill, Cari Moskow, myself, and CJ Thompson. Produced by James Cahill.<br />
<i>I finished <a href="http://forresto.livejournal.com/4276.html">the day of filming</a> for this short so high and giddy... measuring and moving lights all day--what fun... We got the film back from the lab and I edited this short together. I love how the full day of work and preparation boils down to 2 minutes. I put a few tiny snips of audio in there from Tom Waits. I hope he doesn't mind.</i></p>
