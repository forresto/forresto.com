<p>One of the things I've taken up since coming here is bread baking.  Does anybody have access to Weaver Street Market bread recipes?  OK, mid-entry I decided to Google it and found this, which isn't 100% helpful but is a good start: http://web.archive.org/web/20071224231126/http://weaverstreetmarket.com/article/display.php?id=173  ...  So now can anybody get me anything more substantial?  I'm especially looking to recreate the Olive one.</p>
