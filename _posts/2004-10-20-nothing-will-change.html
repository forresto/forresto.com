<p>Talking with my mom on the phone last night I think I pinned down my funk to the election. Then watching F911 again tonight I realized that it is a wider funk, because even the best outcome of Nov. 2 will just place another rich bastard in power. And I'm forced to <em>hope</em> for this outcome. And I do hope for this outcome: the other rich bastard... I did my part today. I also gave a little to http://web.archive.org/web/20041130024937/http://www.optruth.org/main.cfm to help pay to get their ad out. Watch it ( <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20051229233927/http://69.31.93.156/NotThere.mov">"Not There"</a> ). It's honest, direct, and good. Donate if you feel like it is worth it. How could you ever spin this message away? Answer: you keep ramming the same lines down America's throat. And, for some sick reason, 49% or so of them are still swallowing. America, I beg of you, for once, just spit.</p>
<p>There is also a heavy sickness of anticipation in my heart for whatever tricks the current bastard's cronies will be pulling out of their sleeves in the next couple of weeks. Can you imagine how disgusting it will be to see the American Spectacle around Usama Bin Ladin's head on a platter? An orgy of admiration and appreciation for the crook... the smirk on his face... the fawning media. I won't be able to take it. I think I'll be forced to cut myself off from the world. </p>
<p>But it could be happening right <a href="http://news.google.com/">now...</a></p>
