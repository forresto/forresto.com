<p>"... Easter represents a demand as well as a promise, a demand not that we sympathize with the crucified Christ, but that we pledge our loyalty to the risen One.  That means <strong>an end to all loyalties, to all people, and to all institutions that crucify</strong>...." - William Sloane Coffin, 1924-2006</p>
