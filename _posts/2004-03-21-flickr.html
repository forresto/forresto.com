<p>This is a test post from <a href="http://www.flickr.com/r/testpost"><img alt="flickr" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/flickr_logo_blog.gif" width="41" height="18" border="0" align="absmiddle" /></a>, a fancy photo sharing thing.</p>
<p>--- {<br />
I never tried friendster b/c nobody ever told me what it could do, but I found <a href="http://www.flickr.com/">flikr</a> b/c of what it can do (share photos really easily), and later realized that it is kindof a social networking thing.  So get on in there!</p>
<p><b>Pros:</b>
<ul>
<li>you can upload 100 photos a month (free, I assume more for some kind of subscription in the future)</li>
<li>nifty flash interface with chat and stuff</li>
<li>post to flickr from mobile phonecam (via email)</li>
<li>post directly to livejournal (and other blogs) from flickr</li>
<li>they seem to have a good livejournal-esque business ethos (the developers are very open to help and take suggestions, + I think that what is free now will always be free, with value-added funtions later)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Cons:</b>
<ul>
<li>they resize your photos to 400px max</li>
<li>the name, but maybe it will grow on me</li>
<li><strike>nobody else I know uses it yet</strike> "beta" growing pains</li>
</ul>
