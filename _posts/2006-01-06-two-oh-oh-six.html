<p>This year has been pretty intensely good.  I still have not unpacked from Japan (was there until August), but I'm not worried about it.  Wednesday I started unpacking stuff, organizing into piles, all that, but was distracted by my own hair and went to cut it.  I just chopped the sides down, and the top and back are still longish... I think I've wanted my hair to be like this for awhile.  So I'm happy with it for now.</p>
<p>I had a good conversation with Ben tonight before the dance.  Condensed version: I have no idea if it will be Asheville or Carrboro or New Zealand for this year, but wherever it is <i>I am prepared to be really happy this year.</i>  He smiled and replied that I probably have a head-start on most of the people in the word then, and I agree.  So <i>that's</i> my New Year's Resolution.</p>
<p>The dancing was hard, hot, and a good good time.</p>
<p>If I keep seeing people I might just pop.</p>
<p>On that note, I leave you with some advice for the new year from Delbert McClinton and Chloe & The Oneders, そしてお正月のアドバイスをどうぞ見てごらん、僕はオルガンを弾いている：<center><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/forresto/80949952/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/37/80949952_7c17c511ed_b.jpg" width="500" height="150" alt="Chloe And The Oneders" class="photo" /></a><br />
