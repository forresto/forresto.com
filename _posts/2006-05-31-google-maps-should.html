<p>Google maps has a new "<a href="http://services.google.com/earth/green/">Green Tips for Summer Trips</a>" section, but if they really wanted to get green, they would add public transport, bike routes, walking and hiking trails, greenways, rails-to-trails, etc. to the map.  For example, searching "hike Georgia to Maine" would show you the <a href="http://www.nps.gov/appa/">AT</a>, "walk Carrboro to UNC" would direct you to the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060528000933/http://www.walkinginfo.org/rt/development.htm">Libba Cotton Bike Way</a>, and "bike Damascus to Abingdon" would suggest the <a href="http://www.vacreepertrail.org/">Virginia Creeper Trail</a>.  Another appreciated feature would be a directions search option to stay off the main roads (and include aforementioned paths) for those of us planning big bike trips.</p>
<p>Google are you listening?  Wanna hire me?</p>
