<p><small>Behemotops: I had an elementary school visit today. They had me demonstrate how to use a knife and fork. Isn't that silly? And then for lunch they gave me a spork.<br />
Behemotops: I haven't seen a spork since P.S. 124 in chinatown.<br />
phuz o: it was surreal the other day i was the only one in the lunchroom using chopsticks<br />
phuz o: everybody else was using sporks eating white rice</small></p>
