<p>I spent a few hours today working on my resume. I'm going to try to apply for a couple of jobs as back up plans, in case I don't want to cross the ocean but do want to leave town. When the time comes to decide, I'm not sure how far I'll want to go from here, or if I'll want to go at all. Durham was not a change in scenery for me as I thought it might be. And what kind of freakin' world is this anyway when I can worry about girls in a time like this. Could I be any more self-centered? I guess it is more rational to worry about girls than war, since there is practically nothing I feel I can do useful to deal with that. Now where's my duct tape?</p>
