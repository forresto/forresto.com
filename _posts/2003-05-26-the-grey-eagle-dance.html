<p>was mighty fine. Missed David and Kelly, but Austin and Minta and Bekki were there, and Austin and I waxed poetic over the magic of wartroot... and how we were all glowy inside from it, and how Eli will be drug there like it or not.</p>
<p>Claire and I had to persuade mom to let me use her car, which took twenty minutes, and the dance ended early. I'm not bitter, but I would have liked to spend more time there.</p>
