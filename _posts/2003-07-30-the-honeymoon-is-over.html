<p>I woke up this morning to another day of rain. Cold, wet, nasty stuff. I'm stuck in the office for eight hours a day for the whole summer break--three weeks--with about 5 hours of work total to get done. For the remainder of the time (one hundred fifteen hours) I have to figure out how to entertain myself... There is Japanese study, that can take half of my time if I am feeling especially <em>majime</em>. Email... I could do that for an hour a day. And there is always internet nerding out, but I did that Mon and Tue and am about done with that. I set up a <a href="http://folktunes.org/forresto/gallery/moblog">moblog</a> within my photogallery that I can post to from <a href="http://www.j-phone.com/english/products/kisyu/j_sh53/index.html">my new phone</a>, and figured out how to show the three latest thumbnails here on the lj. But I need to do something more productive. More productive than a few kb in etherspace that nobody will ever look at. Rrr.</p>
