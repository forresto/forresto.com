<p>Wow. Last night's dream was so complicated, I don't know where to start. I was in a compound for some kind of retreat. I remember so many things going on, but not how they flowed together. I wanted to change into shorts, but didn't have underwear; went into a locker room but there were too many people in there. Three boys were singing the tune to "Pretty Little Bird" while being percussive on the lockers. My high school gym teacher (Laughter?) explained the plans in case of an air attack; we were to go into the bunkers that were eight feet underground. I asked if I could dig a couple more feet for mine. Katie from middle school gave me a big hug, her father standing behind me had a huge beard; they were waiting for some more people to come.</p>
