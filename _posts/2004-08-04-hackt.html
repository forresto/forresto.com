<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photo.gne?id=150716"><img alt="redled" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/150716_s.jpg" class="flickrimg" id="flickrimg4" style="margin-right:5px;float:left;" /></a>I got my <a href="http://www.ozxodus.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=38">Xenium</a> in the mail yesterday, and spent the evening trying to get it to work... at first the led came on, but no setup screen, then after messing with it the led didn't come on, and then, after twiddleing with it one more time, it worked!&nbsp; It was way to easy to update the bios and dashboard and stuff once it was in Xenium OS, cuz it sets up network shares of each drive to which you can dump straight from My Network Places in Windows to the Xbox hdd.</p>
<p>Anyhow, on the lunch break I got <a href="http://xport.xbox-scene.com/emutemplate.php?emu=neogenesis">NeoGenesis</a> working, and the interface surprised me in how well it is designed.&nbsp; Props to the Xport folks for that.&nbsp; I obtained a rom for my favorite Sega game, <a href="http://www.sonicworld.net/newsite/games/sonicspinball/index.php">Sonic Spinball</a> (that's the only game I've played to the end, other than <a href="http://www.3drealms.com/keenhistory/keenhistory2.html">some old PC side-scrollers</a> and Tetris).&nbsp; It works....&nbsp; So now I can play Sega games on the Xbox.&nbsp; Howbout that.</p>
