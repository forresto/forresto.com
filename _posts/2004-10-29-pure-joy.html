<p>god kids are great<br />
i laughed so hard with a 7-year-old today<br />
she had taped translucent blue plastic over her eyes, and was pretending to swim, and the gym was the ocean<br />
then she taped it over her mouth, and i said <em>"but you can't see out of your mouth!"</em><br />
she laughed at me, but it came out like a kazoo buzz<br />
which made us laugh ten times harder<br />
then we took turns singing into it<br />
god kids are great</p>
