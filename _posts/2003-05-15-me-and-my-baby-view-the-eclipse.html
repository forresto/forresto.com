<p>The clouds were cooperative for most of the drama... OFB'ers sighed when they would blow in and block the view, but I think that is beautiful as well... Why are rare things instantly more beautiful than their common counterparts? Diamonds look about the same as glass shards, but people don't get all weak-kneed about those.</p>
