<p>Dear president Bush,</p>
<p>I'm Japanese. My name is Yuuya.  My favorite food is... apple pie. My birthday is September 12th. My constellation is virgo. I'm in ninth grade. I live in Nakano now, tel# 0194-55-1234. Good luck! If you are tired, please eat a sweet pudding. If you are OK, I would like to go to your villa. Please write back if you have time.</p>
<p>Thank you,<br />
Sincerely,<br />
Yuuya</p>
