<blockquote>... Now LaCit has announced a cigar-box-sized terabyte drive for $1200, with a Firewire 800 interface. Storage price/performance curves continue to boggle the mind: I remember the $3000 1GB drive that I was issued for mastering a Voyager CDROM on, and the rare preciousness of it. That was less than a decade ago. This drive is a thousand times for capacious and a third the price. Think about what that means about storage costs in another decade: a petabyte for $400?</p>
