<p>Hap (our instructor) got a phatty flat, and offered to host dinner parties of three group members at a time. Tonight was our night, so we found an exceedingly friendly Chinese restaurant and got takeout. His place was cute, all light and fluffy and simple and postmodern. I mused that maybe the Chinese restaurants here get influenced from China, US Chinese restaurants, and the UK. The food and conversation was good, and we settled in for a truly British movie afterwards... “Yellow Submarine.” It was the first time that I had seen it, and it really made me wish I had a mandate to embark on such an animatory adventure as that. Anybody? Anybody at all want to hook me up?</p>
