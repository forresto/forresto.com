<h1>雨ニモマケズ</h1>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/forresto/440048372/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/440048372_4bb156ab2d_m.jpg" width="192" height="240" style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border-width:0px;" alt="m.k" /></a> not losing to the rain<br />
not losing to the wind<br />
not losing to the snow or to summer's heat<br />
with a strong body<br />
without want<br />
never angering<br />
always smiling quietly<br />
every day four bowls of brown rice<br />
miso and some vegetables to eat<br />
to everything<br />
without judging<br />
carefully watching and listening and understanding<br />
then not forgetting<br />
in the shade of the woods of the pines of the fields<br />
being in a little thatched hut<br />
if there is a sick child in the east<br />
going and watching over them<br />
if there is a tired mother in the west<br />
going and shouldering her sheaf of rice<br />
if there is someone near death in the south<br />
going and saying there's no need to be afraid<br />
if there is a quarrel or a suit in the north<br />
telling them to leave off with such nonsense<br />
when there's drought letting tears fall<br />
when the summer's cold wandering upset<br />
called a blockhead by everyone<br />
without being praised<br />
without being blamed<br />
such a person<br />
i want to become</p>
