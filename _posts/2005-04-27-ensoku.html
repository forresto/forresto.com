<p>遠足 【えんそく】 (n) trip; hike; picnic;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/forresto/11172614/" title="のびよ大和"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/11172614_87dd5374a5_t.jpg" width="75" height="100" alt="yamato" align="left" class="picture" style="margin-right:10px;" /></a>If my four schools are in a contest for my affection, I think Yamato (my tiny school) is the only one that knows about it.  I like all of my schools, and have a good time at all of them, but I'm totally in love with Yamato.  The 8th and 9th graders are in Tokyo on their school trip this week, so I was invited to do "ensoku" with the 7th graders.  We rode bikes about twelve km to Ohno, played nine holes of park golf (like golf+croquet, a primarily octogenarian sport), learned Go Fish in English, did somersaults down a hill, pet baby goats, ate curry for lunch, then rode back.  There were three students, two teachers, the principal, and myself on this trip.  It was a beautiful day for a bike ride, sunny and breezy.  Oh yeah, I won at golf!  42/par 33, beginner's luck.  There were even prizes; I won some chocolate-filled pretzel things.</p>
<p>After the ride back I finished off the day playing with the elemantary kids outside for an hour.</p>
<p>So yeah, the teaching life is rough here in Iwate...</p>
