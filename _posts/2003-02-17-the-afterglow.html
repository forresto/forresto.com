<p>I woke up the morning inspecting my feelings...</p>
<p>I had a dream with Aisling and her brother doing a Rogers/Astaire/Icedance thing in a house filled with greenery as a response to my little tapdance + acapella version of "Life Could Be a Dream."</p>
<p>I think the pattern is easy to spot... The day after is a daze... practical issues like getting a phone number are glazed over and all you need is to space out. The day after the day after is blue, filled with self-doubt and self-questioning.</p>
<p>And the third day is the test. When I woke up I felt at peace with the situation, whatever the outcome might be.</p>
<p><i>Oh, life could be a dream (sh-boom)<br />
If I could take you up in paradise up above (sh-boom)<br />
If you would tell me I'm the only one that you love<br />
Life could be a dream, sweetheart<br />
(Hello, hello again, sh-boom and hopin' we'll meet again)</i></p>
