<p>Wow!  Taneichi just got five Peruanas.  They are two sisters and three daughters (one, four, and six years old), and I assume that one of the sisters is married to a Japanese man, because the girls have Japanese names.  The sisters are very nice, we chatted a little in a beautifully convoluted chanpo&ntilde;ol<a title="chanpoñol = chanpon + Español ... chanpon = cultural / linguistic Japanese melange" name="chanpon">*</a>, which was fun in a brain-stretching kindof way.  They just moved to an apartment in &Ocirc;sawa, and the girls will be going to J&ocirc;nai.  I hope this might be my in to visit the elementary school side more often, like every week.  The mother has lived in Japan for nine years.</p>
<p>I didn't see this one coming at all; I bet my life in Taneichi just got considerably more interesting.</p>
