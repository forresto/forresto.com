<p>Awesome and a half: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImfDX4S75pM">its-carrboro.mp3</a>, and here is a taste:<br />
<blockquote>... I’m shoppin at Tha Weave * - the total is twenty<br /> He don’t pull out a Jackson, you know he’s droppin’ Plenty<br /> At the Farmers Market I buy my spinich<br /> For the prez I want Dennis Kucinich <a href="http://www.customserenade.com/its-carrboro/ ">... [full lyrics]</a></p></blockquote>
