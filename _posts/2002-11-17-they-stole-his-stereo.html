<p>So I have been hearing about this friend's birthday party all week and planning on going in the back of my mind... Last night in the studio I was going to blow it off and just get more work done, but I figured what the hey, called another friend and left a message to come and get me on her way if she happened to get the message.</p>
<p>So she came and I was thinking about still blowing it off, but hey, it was a Saturday night... We went to cosmic where it became known that I was not supposed to come, she did not get my message, and she was not going to take<br />
me.</p>
<p>I feel so / uninvited<br />
(uninhibited / let it go let it go)<br />
and they stole his stereo</p>
