<p>i've been practicing for a long time, i've stretched a tightrope from here to not here, and i was getting ready to walk away</p>
<p>i psyched myself up for months to do it, i told all of my friends to come watch... they were happy for me to do the feat, and sufficiently sad to the thought of me going. it was to be an event.</p>
<p>so i mounted my tightrope that goes from here to away, and took the first step, stumbled and slipped.</p>
<p>i was left dangling by the crook of my right knee, and felt pretty stupid</p>
