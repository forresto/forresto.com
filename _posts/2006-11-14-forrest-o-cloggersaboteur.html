<p>That's my new title I think... they are actually the same word, as the first cloggers were Welsh factory workers that wore wooden-soled shoes (clogs) to keep themselves off of the wet floors, and the first saboteurs were pissed French factory workers that threw their wooden-soled shoes (sabots) into the machines (or so the story goes).</p>
