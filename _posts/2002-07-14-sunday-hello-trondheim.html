<p>I stayed asleep for most of the morning, then it was time to explore the town with the group. I really like the simplicity of the architecture here. It seems a little boxy, I suppose, but I bet this mode is efficient. Guys walk around with their shirts off per normal, we observe, so Mike and I capitulate and do as the Romans. Norwegians. We are strategically ignored, but that is all right... we are blending in, oh yes. Maybe.</p>
