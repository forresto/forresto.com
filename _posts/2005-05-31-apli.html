<p>I finally figured out how to put java games on my mobile telephone.&nbsp; Here are the good free ones I've found so far:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20051128091242/http://appget.com/vf/pc/apview_025191.htm">糸通し</a><br />
(Thread the Needle) - Like a flight simulator with thread instead of a<br />
plane.&nbsp; Who knew a one-button game could be so thrilling?
  </li>
<li><a href="http://www.sunflat.net/ja/games/sfcave3d.php">3D-SFCave</a> - Same idea as above: press the button to climb, let it go to fall.&nbsp; You can play this one in your browser too. <font style="font-style: italic;" size="1">(<a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2005/05/27/addictive_sfcave_gam.html">via boingboing</a>)</font>
  </li>
<li><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20051210072928/http://appget.com/vf/pc/apview_024514.htm">カードパック2005</a> - Three kinds of solitaire, standard stuff
  </li>
<li><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070202121651/http://appget.com/vf/pc/apview_012068.htm">StopTheMadness</a> - Four-way tetris that I'm pretty sure is impossible to play because of poor game design, but I keep going back.</li>
</ol>
<p>(I also tried this game called <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20051113190025/http://appget.com/vf/pc/apview_025237.htm">Human Fly</a> about a boy with stretchy arms that likes to see how far he can fling himself.&nbsp; I was shocked from my naïveté when I finally figured out it was a striptease.)</p>
<p>These will give <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050308211626/http://www.sharp.co.jp/products/jsh53/">my keitai</a> some more purpose in life once I leave Japan.&nbsp; Does anybody know any other good mobile java games?</p>
