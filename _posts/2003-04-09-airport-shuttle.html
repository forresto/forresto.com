<p>I don't know if I've ever had a flash-back to a future event before Sunday, but that's the best description I can come up with for the feeling that washed over me... I got onto the bus, and something about the antiseptic/mechanical smell and feel made me feel deeply that I was in the airport and on my way. I had to catch my breath a little bit there.</p>
<p>Ever wonder <a href="http://archive.org/movies/details-db.php?collection=prelinger&collectionid=00384" target="_top">how far can young people go in petting and still stay within the bounds of personal standards and social mores</a>? Or what <a href="http://archive.org/movies/movies-details-db.php?collection=prelinger&collectionid=08013b" target="_top">cigarettes do for fun</a>?</p>
