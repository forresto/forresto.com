<p>I found out that my contract has finally been nailed down as beginning on the first, so that gives me time to help Daniel on the moratorium video, see my buds graduate, and go to the folkschool to collect tunes. I finished work on the <a href="http://www.advocacynet.org/cpage_view/startingsmall_01home_19_110.html" target="_top">unicef pages</a> this afternoon for <a href="http://www.advocacynet.org/" target="_top">advocacy.net</a>. I wonder if I get any credit for this...</p>
<p>The teaching in Japan people sent me a huge package of info yesterday, with lots on Iwate and the region... there is skiing and kayaking and free camping in the national parks... and national parks fill the prefecture. (This is me accentuating anything positive about this and ignoring the inevitable pain of separation and ripping up roots.)</p>
