There isn't much of a recipe beyond fresh ugly tomatoes, water, a bullion cube, spices, olive oil, and time.  After it has boiled down for awhile, strain and blend the chunky stuff.  I added bulgar wheat; barley would have been good too.  Top with some stinky hard cheese and/or yogurt and basil.</p>
