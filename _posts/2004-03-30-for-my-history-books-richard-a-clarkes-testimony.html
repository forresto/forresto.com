<p>The wheels are coming off. <a href="http://www.onlisareinsradar.com/archives/002098.php">The Daily Show take on it</a> is quite good. This is the punchline, pulled from <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0403/24/bn.00.html">the transcript</a>:<br />
<blockquote>THOMPSON: But you will admit that what you said in August of 2002 is inconsistent with what you say in your book? </p>
<p>CLARKE: No, I don't think it's inconsistent at all. I think, as I said in your last round of questioning, Governor, that it's really a matter here of emphasis and tone. I mean, what you're suggesting, perhaps, is that as special assistant to the president of the United States when asked to give a press backgrounder I should spend my time in that press backgrounder criticizing him. I think that's somewhat of an unrealistic thing to expect. </p>
<p>THOMPSON: Well, what it suggests to me is that there is one standard of candor and morality for White House special assistants and another standard of candor and morality for the rest of America. </p>
<p>CLARKE: I don't get that. <b>I don't think it's a question of morality at all. I think it's a question of politics.</b> </p>
<p>THOMPSON: Well, I...</p>
<p>[(*choke*)]</p>
<p>(APPLAUSE)</p>
<p>THOMPSON: I'm not a Washington insider. I've never been a special assistant in the White House. I'm from the Midwest. So I think I'll leave it there.</p></blockquote>
<p>Narf! I'm from the Midwest so I'm completely ignorant about the concept of spin. No, actually I just wanted to accentuate the fact that anything that the Whitehouse comes out with is probably bulls#!+.</p>
