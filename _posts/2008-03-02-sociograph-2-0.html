<p>An idea that has been brewing for some time...</p>
<p><a href="http://apps.facebook.com/sociograph/" target="_blank"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/s320x240" width="285" height="240" border="0" /><br />

<p>The 1.0 version was clunky, in Java, and relied on me racking my brain to figure out how everybody I knew was connected and entering the data manually. Day after day I would add to the dataset, until I finally realized that I was becoming obsessive and I had to stop, as the job was neverending. If we were even acquainted in 2002 you are probably in there...</p>

<p>But now it is 2008 and we have fun things like <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/documentation.php">API</a>s to play with. The only data that I can get to easily to connect people is groups, but I would like this to have more connections graphed. The connections are shallower than my hand-coded graph, but infinitely broader.</p>
<p>I need 5 people to <a href="http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php?id=2422767042">add it</a> in order to release it into the wild, so if you think it is at all neat please do. All suggestions welcome, of course.</p>
