<p>I've been writing reams lately to try and figure stuff out in time for my imminent departure... two freaking weeks now. Wow I'm excited. Was in Brasstown for the night last night. I recorded music with Annie Fain, then stayed up late discussing issues with JN, which was fun.</p>
<p>My tickets arrive Friday, and the documents I have to send to the consulate arrive soon (I sure hope). This better not get messed up again.</p>
