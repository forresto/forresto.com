<p>Your hair travelling for a long time, came in the package.</p>
<p><!--more read the original japanese version and an explination-->君の髪の毛は長い間旅行して、パッケージの中に来たよ。</p>
<p>i was vegeing out in the living room and hanna called me into the kitchen... one of minta's hairs was entwined on a twist-tie of dry fruit that she sent me in the loving-care package. i'm pretty sure hanna is in love with her.</p>
