<p>Two speakers today during class, one that works with the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/">bbc</a>, the other with the <a href="http://www.bfi.org.uk/">bfi</a>. We learned about how <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/horizon/">modern documentaries</a> are deceitful in the name of <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/vanished/sten_theories.html">creating a mystery</a> where there might have not been one before. Also learned that there is racism here (in addition to the more dominant classism), and learned even more how filmmakers dealt with Margaret Thatcher. The film reaction is a bit subtler than the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/uk/england/newsid_2091000/2091660.stm">cricket bat</a>, but definitely as interesting.</p>
