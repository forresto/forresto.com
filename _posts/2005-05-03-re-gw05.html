<p>I dreamt I kissed someone in a van last night... the setting was a parking lot somewhere in Iwate... and then there were a couple of guys that showed up and stopped things from going further, but I think they were innocently ignorant of their c-blockage.  One guy was called Brian and he had just bought a record label from Phish.  We discussed the economics of jam-band fan-bases.</p>
