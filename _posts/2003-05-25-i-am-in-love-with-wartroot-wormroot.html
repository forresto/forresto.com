<p>The party there last night was so good... a bouncy castle (which became limp under the pressure of so many non-five-yr-olds), the game of point (where amazingly mismatched wrestling matches are the name of the game, I actually succeeded in restraining somebody at least 50% heavier than me thanks to some Brazilian Jiu Jitsu action, he was a big dude), getting toasty (burnt) this morning in the lawn playing das boot and spades, the game of mafia (I was part of the Mob, Minta right next to me the Gaurdian Angel, and she knocked me out posthaste), story time (with Roan's hilarious six-yr-old lawn-mowing story), getting a haircut in the thyme garden yesterday...</p>
<p>all of these things and so much more fill me with warmth and happiness to think about</p>
