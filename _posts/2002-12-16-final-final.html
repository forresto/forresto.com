<p>tomorrow is my final final<br />
i'm about to go study for it<br />
i need to regulate to<br />
get where my current goal is set</p>
<p>but i also need to let it go<br />
if it needs to go<br />
if i can't perform</p>
<p>i also had a dream last night in which i was driving a recumbent car as if it were a bicycle, or maybe it was todd's, but south graham st chapel hill had a bunch of outdoor pizza parlors</p>
