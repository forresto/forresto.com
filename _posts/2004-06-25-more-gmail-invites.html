<p>I have more Gmail invites than friends that want in, and since I got invited by searching the web and harassing random folk (thanks Kenny for the invite!), I've decided to return the love.  Here's the catch, you (oh random searcher) have to write a Haiku about fish.  That's 5-7-5 syllables; ready, set, go!</p>
