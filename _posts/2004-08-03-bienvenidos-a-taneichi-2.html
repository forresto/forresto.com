<p>Hey, Taneichi just got yet another ridiculously cute 半分ちゃん. She proclaimed "I don't have to learn English!" and I responded "I know, you have to teach it!" The mom is Japanese, the papa from Alabama, the kid is going to Shukunohe, and that's all I know. It was especially cute when the mom said "Alabama" in katakana and the girl interjected "Alabama!" with a touch of country.</p>
<p>It was a bit of a challenge for me to not speak to them in <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/forrestino/100135.html">Spanish</a>, haha.</p>
