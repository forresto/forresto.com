<p>[ edit: Surf class goes rain or shine. Also: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20040820065106/http://www.jibjab.com/swfs/mv_la_movie01.swf">speaking of political ads...</a> ]</p>
<p><strike>The first surf class was a washout, boo.</strike>  I'm gonna go down and see if anybody is in the water, but the rain is really coming down, so I doubt it.  In the mean time, check out these political ads from the '52 election.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skO4yUHhieI">I Love the Gov'</a> (female jazz singer)<br />
<blockquote>Adlai, love you madly,<br />
And what you did for your own great state,<br />
You're gonna do for the rest of the 48.<br />
Didn't know much about him before he came.<br />
But now my heart's a ballot that bears his name.</p></blockquote>
<p><em>Hello</em> Kerry... like totally get a clue. Hire some songwriters for your next ad! Or better yet, some animators <em>and</em> songwriters:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fCboQKkwQA">Ike for President</a> (animated song)<br />
<blockquote>You like Ike, I like Ike, Everybody likes Ikeâ€”for president.<br />
Bring out the banners, beat the drums,<br />
We'll take Ike to Washington. </p></blockquote>
<p>These are from <a href="http://livingroomcandidate.movingimage.us/">The Livingroom Candidate</a>, the complete collection of presidential television campaign ads (c/o The American Museum of the Moving Image, my future employer).</p>
