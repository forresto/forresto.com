<p>I had a date of sorts, and the clear day had turned into a freeeeeezing night when I walked back home. I guess the clouds insulate the night most of the time, cause comparitively it was really bitter.</p>
<p>It doesn’t get dark here, just dusky for awhile between sundown and sunup. Apparently there is even more day where we are headed (six hours north of Oslo). Can’t wait.</p>
