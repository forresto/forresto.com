<p>Rain and sun again today. We got to sleep in an hour, then I had a nice breakfast of leftover spinach curry ramen.</p>
<p>After class we went to see <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0286499">Bend it Like Beckham</a> at the local Odeon as part of the study abroad program. Though it was panned by most of the guys as a “chick flick” I still recommend it for the culture lesson. The movie made me wrap myself up in the story, so I forgot that it is kind of chick flicky. My only problem with it was that it seemed way to happy; maybe that is what makes it a chick flick.</p>
<p>So, go see it when it comes out over there.</p>
