<p>It was cloudy but warm this morning, but as soon as the marine sports started up it started to rain. No thunder or lightning, though, so the show went on. I was just sitting there shivering, but then decided to get on and do something... There were surf lessons, and they actually found a suit big enough for me. The rain made the top of the ocean fresh, which was kind of nice when getting a mouthful of wave. They told me that the waves were not that great for beginners, and told me about another beach down by Nakano (one of my schools) that has better / easier waves. I feel like I was supposed to be a beach kid. Not that I don't love the mountains, but here I get the cake and the ice cream [and I can eat it (real bad)].</p>
<p>It has been a very long weekend. I'm feeling good. I might write a mass email tomorrow.</p>
