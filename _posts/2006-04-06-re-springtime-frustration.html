<blockquote><p> Poor Reproductive Performance in Captivity</p>
<p>Captive breeding problems observed in cheetahs may be largely due to husbandry and management styles rather than genetic problems. CRC scientists are collecting behavioral and hormone data on captive cheetah populations to test the impact of different management schemes on cheetah reproductive performance.</p>
<p>Regular behavioral observations combined with fecal hormone monitoring allow a noninvasive approach to carry out long-term studies on this endangered species and provide solutions to breeding problems as well as fascinating insights into their reproductive physiology and behavior<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060426221940/http://nationalzoo.si.edu/ConservationAndScience/EndangeredSpecies/Cheetah/">...</a> </p></blockquote>
