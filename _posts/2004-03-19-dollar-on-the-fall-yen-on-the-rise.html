<p>So I was going to send money home back when dollars were around &yen;105, but then they shot back up to &yen;112, and now in the past week they have fallen back around &yen;106... so the question is: buy, sell, or hold.  I don't know much about international currency markets, but it seems like Japan wouldn't want the dollar to be any weaker than this.  I have heard something like Bush is embracing a weak dollar (to help exports).  Since I've been here it has been as high as &yen;120 and as low as &yen;105.  <!--more keep your eye on the bouncing line--><br />

But I'm not going to think about it too much, lest I become Gordon Gekko.</p>
