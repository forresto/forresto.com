  <p>Where were we... the countdown... the non-end of the world... ah yes.</p>
<p>New Year's day had a special breakfast, in the traditional Japanese style. Back in the US, I explained, we eat collard greens and black eyed peas for money and health in the New Year. Here in Japan, pounded rice starch (called "mochi") is the official New Year's "tabemono" ("eat-thing," food). There are all kinds of different ways to prepare mochi, but my favorite has a sweet bean concoction inside. This is "mochitsuki." So back to New Year's breakfast, Japanese style meals have lots and lots of dishes. (I knew this before I came to Japan, as I was the dish-washer/bus-person at a "Japanese steak house.") This is to keep the food's flavors from mingling. The meal's mochi was in the miso soup... lots of fun to eat the hot goop with chopsticks.</p>
<p>On the 2nd I got to meet my Host Mother's family. They lived way out in the country, which seemed to make them much more laid back than city folk. The whole atmosphere seemed to have slower pace. Even though they "lived way out in the country" we were still a short car ride from the pachinko parlor and the karaoke center. We did both... My host aunt won about $70 at pachinko--she spent only ~$10. I spent $5 (the least possible). All I won was 3 minutes of watching metal balls fall through nails. Then I was out. I was a lot more successful at karaoke, scoring a 94 on BF5's "Jackson Cannery." The machine rates you on tempo and pitch. Pretty neat system, if you ask me.</p>
<p>My host uncle gave me 5000. This brings my total New Years booty to 25000 ($250). This giving money to the young people is called "otoushidama." I certainly do like this New Year's tradition. I don't know how long this money will last me, though... I read last month that Japan is the most expensive country in the world. It is strange to see import CDs that are consistently half as much as the same domestic version. Going to the movies is $15; this is with the student discount. T- and Sweat- shirts are commonly $40-$100+. I did find a "used clothes store." Funny thing is, all of the clothes seem to come from thrift stores in the US. I even saw a tourist shirt from Lake Lure, NC... about 30 minutes from my Hendersonville.</p>
<p>I discovered that downtown is really not that far from my school. Walking saves me , and gives a better view of the shops, etc. at street level. It takes a long time, but hey, that's all I've got... and It (the proverbial "It") is in the journey, not the destination.</p>
<p>Walking also uncovered the blood donation room of the J- Red Cross Society. So I went up... At first they said that I could not give blood if I could not read the Japanese "have you slept with racy women lately" quiz. I could read the first question ("Are you feeling good today?"), but after that I was a bit lost. They found an English question list, and decided to let me use that. Based on my height and weight they decided to drain the "Wimp Level" donation from me: 200mL. Just as well, back in the States they couldn't get enough from me to fill the big bag.</p>
<p>After the draining they showed me the free drink machine, just push the button. I recovered with my new, pale, stranger/friends watching a comedian on TV. His calling-card joke seemed to be to call out "TAmago taMAgo tamaGOooh" ("egg, egg, egg"). Perhaps someday I will be able to understand at least one Japanese joke. That night at supper I told my host family about the day's adventures. My host mother was very proud of me for giving blood, and they all applauded for a bit.</p>
<p>Coming of Age Day was the 10th... Everybody that is turning 20 this year gets a new Kimono (the women) or suit (the men) and go through some ceremony. 20 years old means that they can now legally buy tobako and biiru. I wasn't invited to the ceremony, but I can imagine what it would be like... and am not sad at not getting to go. I did see plenty of spiffy twenty-year-olds in the train.</p>
<p>Monday was also a local matsuuri (festival). The main event was a huge bamboo bonfire and mochi roast. Mochi is roasted much like marshmallows are, except our sticks were bamboo. That morning my host Father and several of his friends made sake thermoses out of thick bamboo. (Sake is rice wine. Gross stuff.) They also made cups to drink the sake at the festival. I was not much help to them, because I was busy making two bamboo digeridoo (woo-hoo!).<br />
Signing off,<br />
Wishing you health & wealth & friends by the score this year,<br />
