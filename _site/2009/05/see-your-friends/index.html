  <p>2009-05-26</p>

  <p>Saturday we set off in search of the recommended Bauhaus coffee shop, where they made a nice macchiato.  The books were more for show than to be a bookshop, but I found an Atlas of 1962 and showed the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Century_21_Exposition">World's Fair</a> page to my dad.  He remembered being twelve and reading about the monorail and thinking that it was straight from the future.  World's Fairs are funny things, leaving strange artifacts from the past's future in cities all over.</p>
<p>I got to tango to <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100104052355/http://www.tangabrazo.com/biographies.php">live music</a> for the first time, which was great.  The triangle needs a tango band; it's too bad that bandoneons are so hard to come by and cost an arm and a leg, since you need both arms to play.</p>
<p>After the contra dance I heard about a good local act at blues bar, and tagged along with Maya and Quincy.  By the time we got there I could barely hold my head up, let alone dance, but I enjoyed the music from the corner.  An older guy leaned over and asked if Q & M were professional dancers, and said that they should be paid, since they were more entertaining to watch than the band.</p>
<p>Sunday I found my favorite street act of the weekend, <a href="http://www.myspace.com/badmittenmusic">The Bad Mitten Orchestre</a>.  I didn't realize that their name is like badminton, ha.  Then I found Genevieve, who has somehow been far from me for seven or eight years.  If you have a good friend that been far for far too long, find any excuse you can to remedy that soon, like now!  We talked about all of the different levels of communication that happen between two people, and how all that time seemed like more of a superficial distance when compared to the deeper levels of communication that were still very present, natural, and strong.</p>
