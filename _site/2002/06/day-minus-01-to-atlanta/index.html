  <p>2002-06-27</p>

  <p>Leave the <a href="http://www.folkschool.org">Folk School</a> after saying goodbye to my kids. They seemed like a good bunch... They showed the required respect for Frank and carving. <i>"Remember your gloves, thumbguards, pants..."</i></p>
<p>My marionette will have to wait for completion, I guess. The monk would have been a cool toy for the trip, but maybe a bit unwieldy. Besides, it's against the law to perform in London, I hear. I'm not quite sure of the merit of a law that outlaws busking. That's an understatement for sure, I am quite deadset against it... Creative begging and all forms of street art should be allowed, even encouraged. I once saw a beggar in a tree, fishing for change in a crumpled McDonald's cup on a string. I don't know how effective it was for him, but hopefully more effective then just looking sad.</p>
<p>Not that all beggars are not sad, but hey... I guess I have no idea what I'm talking about. Kriti's project seems like an awesome middle ground.</p>
<p>So I left the folkschool, and headed to Atlanta to visit John Neil and family before flying across the ocean. John Neil is a lifelong friend (well, his lifelong I suppose, since he in younger than me) who was diagnosed with bone cancer earlier this year. Doctors are optimistic about a pretty full recovery, but treatment plans dashed dreams of coming to UNC this fall, following in his father’s footsteps. This bummed me out, because I was looking forward to acting the big brother to him for my remaining time there (I graduate in December, woo).</p>
<p>John Neil was in what they call good spirits. It was amazing to see the life in his eyes still shining after such invasive surgery. I wish we could have travelled to the future and gotten him fixed up there... it would have been a simple outpatient procedure I bet. But we are here now, and they had to get it out now, so they got it out. They think they got it all, and we all surely hope so. John Neil has so much love and support around him from his friends and family, it was wonderful to experience just that. He is going to get through it fine, I just know it.</p>
