  <p>So how have you been? I&#39;ve been<br />
Japan is a place that everybody should experience, based on what I have seen so far. I chose this place for food, language, &amp; culture. I also wanted to be &#39;&#39;minority.&#39;&#39;<br />
I have not been disappointed with regards to this last reason. Tall. Walking through Hiroshima&#39;s huge shopping complex I could see a sea of the tops of peoples heads. In the grocery store the shelves don&#39;t obstruct my view at all. This has it&#39;s advantages: my host mom can&#39;t lose me unless she wants to, and I can be found easily. The disadvantages are quite evident whenever I forget to duck enough for the eye-level doorways. Luckily they are eye-level instead of, say, forehead-level--I don&#39;t forget too often. I felt like a tall freak when I got fitted for my school uniform yesterday, and the tailors had a grand old time calling out my measurements to each other. Hyaku-ku-juu shini! If you were wondering, I wear size 78 pants.<br />
Instead of sending letters home I should just write down everything that I eat... Sushi - Sashimi - Tako Maki (fried octopus balls) - Mr. Donut - &#39;&#39;Jelly&#39;&#39; (see food warning in the PS) - Spaghetti - Salad (everyday with breakfast)... One night I put Nori (seaweed) on the American macaroni and cheese; later I put maple syrup on the steamed rice. Both &#39;&#39;incidents&#39;&#39; sparked a condescending glance from my host father. Then my host mom, grandmother, and grandfather would try the crazy combination. Next time you have macaroni and cheese I highly recommend slapping some &#39;&#39;Hello Kitty&#39;&#39; brand Nori on it. Good stuff. My host family was impressed at how well I can use chop sticks. I knew working at Yoshida was good for something.<br />
It seems that every day my host mom says &#39;&#39;let&#39;s going!&#39;&#39; I then roll out of bed, grab my pouch, and wonder where exactly it is that let&#39;s going and what I will find there...<br />
Saturday we went to the marina, and got on a boat. After a few minutes I figured out that it was a Rotary function, the club that sponsors the scholarship that I am under. We cruised away from Hiroshima for awhile, then pulled up next to a fishing boat. The boat let down it&#39;s nets, tooled around for a bit, then pulled them back up, full of shrimp, octopi, crab, and some type of silver metallic fish. I thought to myself: &#39;&#39;Please let there be cooking involved sometime soon.&#39;&#39; Soon after this thought my host father decided to show off his Japaneseness to me by eating a raw ebi (shrimp). Then he gave me a big toothy smile and a wonderful Japanese laugh.<br />
&#39;&#39;Dame? (You wanna try it?)&#39;&#39;[sic]<br />
&#39;&#39;Iie, arigato. (No, thank you.)&#39;&#39;[sic]<br />
Luckily, this was not to be a sashimi feast. Our boat pulled up to the private island (owned by one of the rotarian&#39;s company) where several grills were set up for us. I tried most of the gifts from the sea. Pumpkin, corn, and bell peppers were also grilled, so my vegetarian belly was quite satisfied by the end of the meal. I was amused by the little photo shoot going on next to the three hanging octopi.<br />
I was then invited to go up the hill to the bath house. I have affectionatly dubbed these places &#39;&#39;old naked men stew.&#39;&#39; I sat there, looking out over the inland sea, contimplating the meaning of life, (etc. etc.)<br />
Sunday when I woke and got into the car for the day&#39;s let&#39;s going I did not bring a tooth brush. I did not know it would be an over nighter... We drove north and north and north... hours on hours, until...<br />
Finnaly we got to our first destination, a secluded grave site. A dictionary converstion (the conversations with the family so far have consisted of one or two words, pointed at in the dictionary) gave me the scoop: &#39;&#39;friend, dead.&#39;&#39; The grave visitation was not as grave as it would be here. The flowers were changed, the stone washed, and and open &#39;&#39;Asahi&#39;&#39; beer and a lit cigarette placed on the marble monument for the deceased. We knelt down, hands clasped together, prayed for a moment, took a picture, and left.<br />
We then found our way to MOBA, the Museum Of Bohemian Art. The theme was hour glasses, the center peice a gargantuan one year peice, suspended above our heads. A video moniter assured us that the sand of time were, yes, falling. (Ceacelessly.)<br />
Next stop, a 100 year old restaurant. Don&#39;t forget to trade your shoes at the door for the slippers that only go to your heels... we sat on the floor here. I later figured out that we would also be spending the night here. Supper converstions shifted from my name (my host family calls me &#39;&#39;Forresto,&#39;&#39; one of thier friends could only get &#39;&#39;Horrish&#39;&#39; to come from his mouth) to a dictionary converstion (snore). A natural salt water &#39;&#39;stew&#39;&#39; (that is, hot bath), and bed time. Men and women sleep in separate rooms. Before I went to sleep, one of my host father&#39;s friends was nice enough to give me some ear plugs. I think that is a custom in Japan that when men sleep in the same room to have a contest. Whoever can snore the loudest is the stongest, best, most virile of the bunch. I lost. The earplugs did help, and, as the packaging pointed out, NASA uses the same brand.<br />
I want to send this now, so th tha that&#39;s all folkies...<br />

PS I expected to see English in Japan. I did not expect it to be everywhere that I looked... Here are some examples of English (more or less) that I have seen so far:</p>
