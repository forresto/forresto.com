  <p>2003-04-25</p>

  <p>I had a huge soft-serve ice cream cone of the waffle persuasion. Blue or purple ice cream. I decided to eat away at the edge of the cone, leaving a huge tottering blob of soft-servedness, which of course slumped over and fell on the couch. I picked it up, though... plopped it back on the tiny piece of cone that was left.</p>
<p>Then I went towards the theatre, and remembered how silly it was that the stairs to the door were about a foot wide, and the door itself was about six inches by three feet... The girl behind me was recounting how difficult it was for the 30 or so of them to run up and cram through there during a play.</p>
<p>Then I realized that I was in a play that was opening at that very moment, and didn't know my lines, and didn't know where the script was. I ran around looking for my bag, but the running my me feel like I was going to puke (from the ice cream). Somebody in the audience was talking loudly about people on welfare in the ghetto, and the director (Sarah Miller, my high school director) yelled at them that "Yes that's true, but you don't have to <i>say</i> it."</p>
<p>Incredibly nervous about having to go up on stage cold for my part, puking seemed like a good option... then they wouldn't be so mad at me.</p>
<p>Somebody said "You feeling okay, Forrest?"</p>
<p>"Not so good," I yelled in reply.</p>
<p>I then realized that they were on stage, and the play was about somebody with the same name as me in the same situation as me, and that I had just yelled out in the middle of their scene.</p>
