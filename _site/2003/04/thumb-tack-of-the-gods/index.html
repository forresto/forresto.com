  <p>2003-04-11</p>

  <p>Aisling wrote this story to commodification baby, and it spontaneously exploded into a multi-level insane story.</p>
<p>-------------------<br />
last night i picked ellie up in the rain...i couldn't see (both visually and mentally) so i threw on the closest pants i could find. when i got back, right before crawling back into my still warm bed, i discovered a thumb tack trapped between my skin and leggings. i have never seen this type of thumbtack before.  i think it came from the gods. <!--more--> I knelt down to give thanks for the glory that was this thumbtack.  I raised my eyes, the blood dribbling down my arm as I tacked my thumb.  It felt like the very first time.  I had never known a thumbtack this good.  i thought of my mother, my sisters. how we would dance in the rain, thumbs tacked together.  the join.  the bind.  i wished for a thundercloud.  for a moment of wet joy.  this thumb, this tack.  where am i now? wherever it is, i know that's where it begins. i know i can never have that bind, the join, again. i can never tack in the rain again. now my hair is too much like fire, when i lay in the sun i never cover my skin. i know. i know what feels like the first time must be last time. i must find something new. i looked in the refrigerator.  noodles.  i looked in the freezer. nothing but frozen tacks and leggings.  i realized i had found it-- the new thing.  the new thing was leggings and thumb tacks.  the first time is always the last time and the last time is always the first time. you can't push the same tack in twice, and leggings are elastic, but not perfectly so. i pulled on the chilly tights and ran out the door, my mind reeling and thighs puckering. the thumb tack, sitting alone in the freezer, cringed.</p>

                      that's the secret of the rainstorm -- the constant collision of sky and skin absolves the grave presence of self-space. the thresholds to all your tacks, your sisters, your mothers, your gods, all, they're unsealed. or rather, played without a mute. the sound heard here is the courier. This game is played without knowing the rules, like molecules bouncing around forming the room you sit in, the food you eat, your lips, your thighs, the petro that is refined into your tights, and the petro and brass that is molded into you tacks. there are tacks on my tongue, and holding flags to their flagpoles, and then there are ships sailing on a starboard tack. make me a blind statue of petro and brass.  will i see you again before they pour you out in the ocean, or will i only remember you by the red pinpricks between my skin?<br />
-------------------</p>
<p>Funny thing is, it wasn't a thumb tack, rather one of those sterile finger-pricking needles, that was definitely not sterile at that point.</p>
