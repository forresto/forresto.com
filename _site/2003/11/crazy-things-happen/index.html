<p>I was reading <a title="''Let Them Eat War''" href="http://www.motherjones.com/commentary/columns/2003/41/we_558_01.html">an article</a> across the room from my friend falling asleep in bed; I had a guitar solo of <i>Blackberry Blossom</i> stuck in my head, playing over and over, and M. asked me if I was playing the guitar. M. thought I was playing the song that our friend was playing last night on his mandolin. <i>Blackberry Blossom</i>. I can't even believe it, but it just happened so I guess I have to. </p>
<p>I am coming down from a good weekend of music performing and jamming. This morning E., two people from his *yakuba*, and myself played four songs in his town's culture festival as <i>Mr. Waln's Mystery Band</i>. They played fiddle and accordion in Irish style, E. is more bluegrassy, and my old-time frailin' self... Mix well and practice twice and you've got a band! Of sorts. It was good fun to play and sing, I even stepped up to the mic. <i>Shady Grove</i> got ridiculously fast for some reason, we did three verses and choruses in about thirty-five seconds. We also played <i>Turkey in the Straw</i>, <i>Sally's Garden</i>, and <i>Akanbo</i>. I had never played any of those songs in those keys before this weekend, so it was a good challenge.</p>
<p>This morning, the night before at the Kawai culture festival with The Ramblers, and the street performance fest in Hachinohe with D. make three times that I have performed in public with a willing (?) audience. I might be getting used to it, but so far it has been a little tough to relax, which causes my playing to suffer and probably gives me a funny face.</p>
<p>I didn't take any pictures, but others did and <a href="http://folktunes.org/forresto/gallery/031031halloweenWeekend">I'll gank them soon enough</a>.</p>
