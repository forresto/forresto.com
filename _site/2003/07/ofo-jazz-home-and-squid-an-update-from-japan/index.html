  <p>2003, July 20</p>
<p>Nango Jazz Fest</p>
<p>I just got back from a really great weekend in Aomori, the prefecture north of here. The main event was the Nango Summer Jazz Festival, this year featuring Jimmy Scott. It was something else to hear such a powerful voice come from somebody who looks like about half of a wisp these days. He sang one of my favorites, "All of Me," as well as "Motherless Child" and some other standards. Some of the other groups played some great swingy stuff, and I tried, with some success, to swing dance with some people. The dancing contingent was about fifteen young drunk Japanese folks and a few gaijin. I danced at least twice a week every week while I was in Hendersonville waiting for my work visa, so I've been missing dancing. It was really nice to move like that some.</p>
<p>My favorite group was called Spanish Connection, featuring fiddle, flamenco guitar, and tabla. They played flamenco stuff as well as tango, but nobody was dancing yet that early in the night. Zannen.</p>
<p>After the fest was a party at the home of Angy, who I met in Taneichi on my second day in Japan. I met tons of folks from all over, including the curator of the local museum that we visited today. Three Japanese people cornered me in the kitchen, and I said something that made them laugh... Once I start to make people laugh it is difficult to get me to shut up, so I kept it rolling... They were almost on the floor... one told me I should be "a Japanese comedian." I thanked her for the complement, but reminded them that it might be a logistical problem to get my entire audience to get drunk before I start.</p>
<p>Usually when I tell a joke it falls flat on it's self: I have to explain that I just made a joke, then they say "Oooh... American joke," and leave it at that. I have yet to penetrate the secret inner-workings of Japanese humor. I've had a lot more success getting people to laugh unintentionally.</p>
<p>For example, I asked if it was OK to drink the tealeaves in the bottom of green tea. They thought that question was really funny, and told the story over and over. Another time, at lunch, a PE teacher told me "Hawaii e ikitai (I want to go to Hawaii)." I responded with a standard "A sou desu ka (Oh, is that so)?" This turned out to be really hilarious, and spread through the cafeteria over the next few minutes. A teacher sitting next to me was kind enough to try and explain why it was so funny. When she said "I want to go to Hawaii" to me the way that she did somehow the meaning "with you" was hidden in there. Of course I didn't catch it, so it really sounded like I was blowing her off when I responded the way that I did. It was all a joke though; I just happened to play into it perfectly. </p>
<p>My house</p>
<p>My house is great. The downstairs is split into four sections: genkan, toilet room and bath room, kitchen, and living room. Upstairs is the bedroom, with traditional tatami flooring. I'll take pictures of the whole place when I get my digital camera slash mobile phone (slash tons of other features, I'll probably talk about how cool it is in a mass email soon enough).</p>
<p>My first night in Japan, at my host family's house, they had a party for me. They fed me tons of good food, and then started drinking. I was dead tired, so I didn't drink more than one or two. The Superintendent of Schools came by, and it was obvious that he had been drinking before, and didn't slow down. He started going on about how there were no bugs in my house. "There used to be bugs," he admitted, "but now, the house is bug free." He said this a few times, and I couldn't figure out why he was going on and on about it.</p>
<p>The next day was the camping trip with a few ALTs from the area. I asked about my predecessor, and they said that she was like a fish out of water. She had quit after a few months, and that is why I was hired early. Apparently, the Board of Education did not help her out when she complained of the bugs, and that was the last straw for her. Suddenly the Super's drunken remarks made sense. I've kept it clean to avoid the bugs, but I had to sweep out something that looked like a hybrid between a cricket and a cockroach the other day.</p>
<p>Food</p>
<p>I have been cooking every day, and coming up with some interesting stuff with the ingredients that are accessible here. My most recent success was a potato / pumpkin curry, on a bed of spinachy brown rice, with fatty bean sprouts in the middle. Mmm.</p>
<p>Today we went to a little market in Hachinohe with lots of stalls selling all kinds of food. They are really into grilling out in Japan, and I got grilled tofu-on-a-stick (tofu dengaku), and sampled the grilled fishes-on-sticks that everybody else got. The salmon was from up north, so it was fatty and delicious. I even tried ika, and didn't think about it till I had chewed a few times. I'm glad I tried it, but I don't know if I'd call myself a fan.</p>
<p>All in all, I'm having a fun time here. I miss home sometimes, but the good things are keeping me afloat. Hug your family for me,</p>
