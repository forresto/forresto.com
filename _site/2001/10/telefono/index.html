  <h1><a href="/2001/10/telefono/" class="link dim near-black">teléfono</a></h1>
  <p>2001-10-23</p>

  <p>She called me when I was in Hendersonville, left a message saying that she heard I was there and that she would call back, as I woke up from dozing on the couch, and ran to the phone, and picked it up to a click... *69 was blocked... 411 info had no info fo me, because I didn't have the right name of the house in which she stays.</p>
<p>This was all quite agonizing for me, because we <u>never</u> talk on the phone, as a rule, almost. I thought it HAD to be something mundane (left a shirt?), either that or something huge (but I try not to let my imagination run too wildly). What could it be???</p>
<p>Then yesterday I get home after the self-mutilation to hear that she called again. Did she leave a number? Aauugh, as I slump to the floor (not really, I caught myself, but I really would have). Tell me <b>exactly</b> what she said. "...and for you to call her back." Aauugh, as I slump to the floor.</p>
<p>Time passes, I am writing a Japanese Public Service Announcement for my journal, and Edison calls up: your mom is on the phone. I just knew it was actually g, so I answer as suavely as possible. After some supreme awkwardness downstairs (they "forgot" to hang up), we talk.</p>
<p>Nothing shockingly major, nothing disappointingly small.</p>
<p><i>& I melt through the floor.</i></p>
