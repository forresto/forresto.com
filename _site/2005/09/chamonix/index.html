  <p>2005-09-04</p>

  <p>I'm out to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamonix">Chamonix, France</a> for the week now.  Hopefully when I get back I'll do a proper update here of my first five weeks in Europe.</p>
<p><!--more-->... Chamonix, according to Lindsey:</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/forresto/42263812/" title="CAF Albert Premier Hut - 8,881 ft (2707 m)"><img src="/assets/42263812_ee4d8ab3cf_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="CAF Albert Premier Hut - 8,881 ft (2707 m)" align="right" /></a> I am back, we got here 7:00 this morning (Sunday).  It was mind blowing, I mean really mind blowing.  We had a very extreme week.  On Monday we hiked to this little cabin like 2,000 meters high on the side of a cliff.  We had bread for lunch and went to the glacier.  We put on these crampons ( big spikes that go on the bottoms the boots so you can walk on ice) and climbed all over the glaciers.  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/forresto/42263857/" title="the extreme ice team"><img src="/assets/42263857_c2691a519f_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="the extreme ice team" align="left" /></a> They asked for the craziest five guys that wanted the most intense trip, I didn't know what they said because it was in Danish but Jens (a teacher) pushed me in that group.  I soon found out what had happened when we were sent jumping across crevasses and straddling black holes in the ice.  Its strange how much you can do when you are scared of disappearing into a black abyss never to come back.  After that we practiced rappelling into these holes and then climbing out with ice picks.  That was pretty challenging also.  When it got dark we went back to the cabin ate rabbit for dinner and went to bed early. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/forresto/42264345/" title="getting our crampon"><img src="/assets/42264345_17a9422ad4_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="crampons cramped on" align="right" /></a> We woke up at 5:00 the next morning and climbed to the bottom of the glacier where we strapped on our crampons got in teams of three, they picked our teams by how fit we were because if one person couldn't make it everybody had to go back. We tied ourselves to a guide and started climbing.  When the sun started coming up it gave us a view like you  have never seen. The sky was blue and clear, you could see Chamonix way down in the valley. We climbed and climbed for three hours.  By the time got to the bottom of the mountains peak the sun had come all the way up, this made it possible to see how high we had actually climbed which was scary.  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/forresto/42265302/" title="Petite Fourche Summit -  11,548 feet (3,520 meters)"><img src="/assets/42265302_3cc847d2f5_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Petite Fourche Summit -  11,548 feet (3,520 meters)" align="left" /></a> We then proceeded to climb these rocks covered with ice and snow to get to the peak. I felt like Frodo Bagins from Lord of the Rings, that is what the scenery looked like.  The top was very cold and windy, a storm had come in and it became very hard to see.  We took some pictures and started back down, I was ready to leave I couldn't feel my fingers and all I could think of was I'll never play music again unless I get the hell out of here.  I was last climbing up so I had to go first climbing down. Luckily  I couldn't see,  we were so high up it could have freaked me out.  The altitude made it harder to breath and you had to keep a clear head to keep from getting freaked out and wanting to just run down.  The name of the mountain was Petite Fourche, it was 3,522 meters high.  We were supposed to climb Aiguille de Tour but the weather conditions made it to dangerous.  Supposedly its the third highest mountain in Europe Mount Blanc being the first.  The group that tried Mont Blanc didn't make it because of the weather.  I really wanted to climb Mont Blanc and almost did but it meant missing out on rafting, rock climbing and mountain biking.  After I found out they didn't make it I was glad I didn't go. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/forresto/42266589/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="/assets/42266589_b1f9311354_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="chamonix-91" align="right" /></a> On Wednesday we went rafting.  This was a sport I have done a lot of so I wasn't as excited but still ready to go.  The guide asked if anybody had ever tried rafting before or wanted to take the more extreme trip, again I didn't understand, and again I was pushed in that group.  We had the small raft of four when most had 8.  Although I have rafted before this was one of the funnest trips I have ever done.   We went down rapids backwards, upside down, in the back of the boat to make the front lift, standing up, all on one side.  We surfed the boat, sunk the boat, flipped on purpose everything you could think of.  The water was really cold, we had to have wet suits and jackets.  It came straight from the glacier we were at the day before.  The guide was so much fun, we pulled other people out of rafts, wet them, tried to make them flip.  We jumped off cliffs, swam rapids, ran the raft up on rocks, did 360's down... you name it. </p>
<p>The next day was mountain biking, and rock climbing day.  I love to mountain bike so I was ready.  First we biked through the city of Chamonix, then went up and up and up.  I mean we climbed it seemed like forever.  Each climb had a different challenge.  One climb only two people had done it out of the whole school, this made me want it even more.  I didn't make that climb without falling it was so steep I couldn't keep my front wheel down.  The next hill the instructor said nobody had climbed without falling.  This time I was determined and I made it, one of my good friends Christian also made it behind me and a girl named Lena, we were the first in the entire school to climb that mountain, it was a great feeling.  A good booster for what was to come, the down hill.  Talk about a rush the down hill made the up hill worth it entirely.  The trail was dug into the side of a cliff straight down on the side and up on the other it curved out and in, rocks, stairs, everything.  We went through rivers streams over bridges, I got a little crazy and tried jumping everything I could, I almost jumped right of the side of the cliff and slowed up a little.  Its great to do these intense adventures because it builds up your confidence but it can go to far and then you hurt yourself.  I tried to keep it right below the hurt yourself, but still go as fast as I could. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/forresto/42269976/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="/assets/42269976_727e56ef1e_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="chamonix-119" align="right" /></a> Next we went rock climbing, I am not really a fan of rock climbing.  I have climbed in Pisgah forest, on outward bound trips and through school before and never really liked it to much.  This isn't a place where you really even have a choice, you just go.  I tried the easy route, it wasn't bad then the next, and then took a break.  I felt done, I secured others, took pictures and chilled out most the rest of the day.  It was almost time to leave and my buddy Christian asked if I had tried the hardest on which had a overhang and you had to climb over.  I said no and he said I had to. After some thought I said ok I'll try not thinking I would even get over the first part.  I tried and it was hard.  All I could hear was my breathing.  Some of the holds were only big enough to put my finger in but it made a huge difference.  Its strange how a little tiny hole can help you lift you entire body to get to the next step.   Any way I eventually made it to the top and again felt a great feeling of confidence and pride take over. </p>
<p> After we got back to the apartments we gathered what money we had left over and went out.  The school had reserved a disco all to ourselves and we watched a video that one of the guides had made of our trip.  We then drank the night away telling stories laughing and joking until morning, got on a bus and drove through Switzerland, Germany and back to Denmark.  It was a great trip.  Forrest is putting the pictures on line so check them out.  I took 130 of them.I think I gave the wrong address for the photos before but it is http://flickr.com/photos/forresto/sets/936105/</p>
<p>Well that's that, we have the day off to relax and get some sleep for tomorrow when it all starts again.</p>
<p>Write me,<br />
talk to you soon,<br />

<p>He captured the week well, and we were in the same groups, so I'm not going to rewrite the week in my own words.</p>
