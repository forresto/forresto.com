  <p>Hej all,</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/forresto/28990015/" title="Ogasawara"><img src="/assets/28990015_cf30003045_m.jpg" alt="P7080264" align="right" height="180" width="240" /></a>I'm<br />
back in Denmark after a week in Chamonix - Mont Blanc, France. Sorry to<br />
those out of the loop, it has been awhile since <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/forresto/147763.html">my last big email</a>. I<br />
hadn't even left Tokyo with my sister... it's been a pretty busy couple<br />
of months since then. Here are some highlights: a week at a youth<br />
hostel in <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/forresto/sets/652565/">Ogasawara</a> (a randomly Japanese tropical island accessible<br />
only by a 25-hour ferry ride),,, back to Iwate with my sister to teach<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/forresto/25679602/">folk dances</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/forresto/25679993/">waltzing</a> to all my students,,, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/forresto/27267790/">goodbyes</a> to all my<br />
schools,,, goodbyes to all my Iwatelope friends,,, helping Taneichi's<br />
new ALTs settle in, translating for them and introducing them to<br />
schools and local festivals,,, getting accepted to <a href="http://www.nih.dk/">Nordjyllands<br />
Idrætshøjskole</a> (North Jutland Sports Folk High School, where I am now)<br />
with 16 days to get from <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/forresto/28075038/">Taneichi, Japan to Brønderslev, Denmark</a>,,,<br />
missing the night bus for my departure,,, taking the shinkansen the<br />
next morning and making onto the plane by half a hair's width (the last<br />
standby passenger accepted),,, four nights at home, including two<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/forresto/30523138/">contra dances</a>,,, <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/forresto/tags/odense" title="Odense"><img src="/assets/33396438_51ca93d421_m.jpg" alt="To øl tak." align="left" height="240" width="180" /></a>then<br />
a plane to Hamburg and a train to Odense, where I meet Lindsey, and the<br />
adventure begins (ha),,, we stay with <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/forresto/33396631/">Hanne "Belle" Jørgensen</a> (formerly<br />
of The Freight Hoppers), get the royal tour, and even get to jam on a<br />
few oldtime tunes,,, get on the train to Brønderslev the next day.<br />
After two train car changes we found some seats that were actually<br />
headed where we were, and settled in for the last couple of hours of<br />
the train ride. As a conductor firmly but politely reminded us, we were<br />
in a "shh, no talking" car. "Oookay," I thought, marking the incident<br />
down as Danish culture shock number one.</p>
<p>We (quietly) rolled into Brønderslev Station, and walked out to meet<br />
the Anders, the school's representative. He took our bags and pointed<br />
the five of us from that train towards the school. Lindsey and I had to<br />
laugh as we started hiking... our first adventure had already been<br />
assigned! We didn't say much of anything to the other kids as we<br />
walked, which is funny to think about now... after a month of living,<br />
eating, working, and playing with them, they feel about as close as can<br />
be.</p>
<p><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/forresto/sets/775958/" title="nih"><img src="/assets/35046040_885e55ff64_m.jpg" alt="" align="right" height="180" width="240" /></a>Everything<br />
leading up to Chamonix now feels like preparation for the trip. They<br />
have all kinds of cool games and activities that people at the school<br />
have come up with over the years. One of my favorites was like a<br />
low-tech laser-tag game (with crumpled newspapers wrapped in tape<br />
instead of lasers) played in a gym full of gymnastic equipment for<br />
obstacles. They also got us to come up with games, in teams, of course.<br />
One of those involved stealing clothespins from the back of the other<br />
team's jerseys, which degraded into a big grabass fest. My favorite was<br />
a kind of soccer / hockey hybrid, with one player of each sport tied<br />
together with bicycle innertubes. That's when I met Bjarni, my big<br />
Icelandic viking friend, who pulled me around the court making me feel<br />
like it was more of a horse-and-chariot competition than anything else.</p>
<p>A more serious competition original to the school (?) is the<br />
bike-and-run. I think this sport might have been born as a practical<br />
solution to a bike shortage, but it's pretty cool. In one of it's<br />
forms, a team of two people with one bike have a 10km course to<br />
complete. When the teacher says "go," they have to copy the course to<br />
their map (one per team). One person starts running, the other starts<br />
biking, and it is up to them how often the biker leaves the bike for<br />
the runner. It's a pretty exciting race, because you don't really know<br />
your position until the end. Even if you are keeping up running with<br />
people from other teams, they might get a bike before you, leaving you<br />
in the dust.</p>
<p>After a month of such team-building hijinks with all these cats we got<br />
in a two-level bus headed for Chamonix, France. <a href="http://forresto.livejournal.com/149086.html">More on that later...</a></p>
