  <p>Long time, no big email... how ya been?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/forresto/7850995/" title="hexagonal origami"><img src="/assets/7850995_818db17774_t.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="hexagonal origami - back" align="left" class="picture" style="margin-right:10px;clear:left;" /></a> Last week's <em>enkai</em> was fairly entertaining.&nbsp; Enkai are a Japanese phenomenon where everyone in an office is obligated to spend lots of money, eat a pile of food, and drink – the later seeming to be the main goal of the evening.&nbsp; Some of my coworkers don't even eat that much, just so they can save room for beer, <em>nihonshu</em> (sake), and <em>shochu</em> (Japanese liquor).&nbsp; There needs to be an excuse for all this revelry, and last Thursday's was in honor of the Superintendent leaving his position.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/forresto/7849324/" title="office randomness"><img src="/assets/7849324_d5ab55f752_t.jpg" width="75" height="100" alt="today's randomness" align="left" class="picture" style="margin-right:10px;clear:left;" /></a> April first is the start of the fiscal year in Japan, and it is also <em>tenkin</em> season, where employees are traded around like so many Pokémon cards.  I think that the higher-ups actually do have smoky meetings in dark back rooms where they speak in hushed tones and shuffle their employees around.  At least that's what I imagine.  The students are on spring break now, so I'm at the Board of Education for a couple of weeks.  Every day a group of transferees will come in and give the standard greeting one by one: “You have taken care of me for X years, thank you very much,” followed by a deep gracious bow.  Then the top guy in the office says some stuff, and we all bow some more.  The teachers often look like they are on the verge of tears, but maybe they are trying to look stoic.  Either way, the last bit of the exchange always seems so wrong to me: a forced, curt, painfully awkward round of applause.  (Yay!  I'm being involuntarily transferred to somewhere totally new and random!  Exactly what I had in mind for the next three years!  Thanks for the applause guys, it's all I needed.)</p>
<p><a href="http://photos8.flickr.com/7924047_1313ca3068.jpg" title="my card, as it were"><img src="/assets/7924047_1313ca3068_t.jpg" width="66" height="100" alt="card" align="left" class="picture" style="margin-right:10px;clear:left;" /></a> I give my card to the teachers that were friendly to me, and it's nice to have a small nonformalized <em>sayonara</em>.  If last year's tenkin is any indication, none of them will call, but that's OK.</p>
<p>Anyhow, with the superintendent on his way out, there is only one person in this office that has been here longer than me, and for all I know they could be on their <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/forrestino/137283.html">way out</a> as well.  The end of March is a crazy time here.  There is a nervous tension in the office, with everyone trying to go about their everyday jobs but unsure of what those could be come April.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/forresto/7355522/" title="enkai vegan sashimi"><img src="/assets/7355522_b66e5d3078_t.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="vegan sashimi" align="left" class="picture" style="margin-right:10px;clear:left;" /></a> I guess the primary function of these official drinking parties is to relieve some of this the tension.  I told Nori, a friend from the town hall, that I'm not too sure about August, and I'm thinking about trying to stay in Taneichi for another year.  We started talking about that, but just then Mayor came up and sat down on the floor with us.  The mayor is an interesting character, elected <small>(?)</small> good-oldest of the good old boys, he speaks with a clip that is pretty hard for me to pick up on.  Japanese men are more difficult to understand than Japanese women (the exception being women from Tsugaru, who have the most overwhelming accent I've heard yet).  There is a macho staccato that has taken me a couple of years to be able to get into the flow of.  People that have had contact with foreigners generally know how to slow and dumb it down enough for me to understand.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/forresto/7355089/" title="el mayor"><img src="/assets/7355089_d24edda93e_t.jpg" width="100" height="67" alt="in which our mayor battles my supervisor for my honor" align="left" class="picture" style="margin-right:10px;clear:left;" /></a> The Mayor doesn't dumb it down, so at these functions an office friend will usually translate what he is saying into Forrest-accessible Japanese.  Tonight Nori was the man for the job.  Apparently the mayor wanted to give me a piece of land with one cedar tree.  I'm not sure about the significance of this gesture, or whether he remembered it the next morning, but we shook on it and had a good laugh.  Then Nori spilled the beans that I'm considering trying to stay for a third year, and we shook and laughed on that too.  The Mayor has a good handshake.  He is also good at sumo, from what I saw....</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/forresto/6963410/" title="swing AND contra"><img src="/assets/6963410_bde9354ff6_t.jpg" width="90" height="100" alt="contra dancing in japan" align="left" class="picture" style="margin-right:10px;clear:left;" /></a> So yeah, I'm thinking about staying.  It doesn't hurt that I got to put together and <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/forrestino/136278.html">call a contra dance</a> last Sunday.  That was a lot of fun.  About seven English teachers showed up for the whole thing, and a bunch locals floated through during the two hours.  We had enough for three hands-four, which is enough.  After my contra thing there was a swing thing, which was good fun as well.  All and all, it was <em>daiseikou</em> (a big success). We're planning another <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/forrestino/137209.html">swing event for next month</a>.</p>
<p>I practiced calling at Yamato, the combined Elementary / Middle school that I go to on Fridays.  I love going to that place.  We did “Sasha” and “Seven Jumps” as part of the elementary pre-graduation celebration.  Everybody was having a blast, students and teachers.  The one boy was pretending to be too cool for a little while in there, but I saw a smile pulling at the corners of his mouth by the end of it.  He'll move up to the world of formal middle school English education in April, along with two classmates.  I've played with them every Friday during recess for almost two years now, so hopefully we can skip the whole shy part of the first year of English.</p>
<p><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/forresto/sets/164381/" title="Yamato graduation"><img src="/assets/6591164_24830e5b28_t.jpg" width="100" height="75" alt="" align="left" class="picture" style="margin-right:10px;clear:left;" /></a> Two middle-schoolers graduated from that school on the 15th, and their future paths have been decided by the tests they passed.  They included Claire in the graduation ceremony, saying “REMEMBER THE TIME... WE TAUGHT FORREST'S SISTER... ABOUT OUR TRADITIONAL DANCE.”  This was one of about twenty “memories” that the students memorize for this part of the ceremony.  They belt these out to each other in a specific order in this even monotone yell.  The whole thing was off-putting when I saw it last year for the first time, but now I find it sweet and endearing.  I'm turning Japanese I think I'm turning Japanese I really think so....</p>
<p>---</p>
<p><strong>Anyhow,</strong> if I decide to not stay, I guess I'll be looking for gainful occupation come August.  Any ideas?  Kids, dancing, music, film, outdoors, environment, surfing, information technology... if one or more of these are involved it would be bonus.</p>
<p>Tell me what you think,<br />
