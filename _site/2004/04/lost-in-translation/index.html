  <p><img alt="lit" src="/assets/B00011RPB0.01.MZZZZZZZ.jpg" class="picture" align="left" /><img alt="esotsm" src="/assets/B00005JMJE.01.MZZZZZZZ.jpg" class="picture" align="right" />Last night I stayed up late, finally watching <em>Lost in Translation</em>. I didn't download it from <a title="open-source eDonkey 2000 client" href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/emule/">eMule</a>, which I can totally see as a slippery slope... it is fairly reliable, you just have to get a High ID and leave it running for a couple of days, and the quality (mostly divx or xvid, which are mpeg-4) is good enough to watch without being too distracted. My justification for not illegally downloading movies is that I would pay if there were an easy legal way, but since there isn't I'm not going to tear myself up over it. I also watched <em>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</em>, which I rank as the only realistic relationship movie ever. Maybe I'll think of another. <!--more more thoughts on &quot;Lost,&quot; maybe spoilers--></p>
<p>Anyhow, <em>Lost</em> pulled up mixed emotions. Everybody I have talked to either strongly liked it or felt so-so about it. I thought the end was kind of stupid, I would have been much more tempted to leave that itch unscratched and left the audience with all that great tension. Why does everything always have to be resolved???</p>
<p>Watching the movie made me feel alienated from Japan... about four times during the couse of the film I had to remember that I do, in fact, live here. Of course *here* is not Tokyo, and a pretty far cry from it, so maybe that is why it seemed so foreign. Being able to understand all of the Japanese in the movie didn't alleviate any of this alienation. Last night at a work party one of the higher-ups came to sit with me and Robert. He was drunk, I wasn't at all. I think it was one of the most awkward conversations ever. So yeah, I understand what you are saying buddy, but it's not so easy to understand where you are coming from!</p>
<p>You know?</p>
<p>Some folks that I talked to and read think that <em>Lost</em> is racist. They say that there could have been at least one intelligent or witty Japanese character. Bob was a dick to the Japanese, but that was his character. There are quite a few *Amerika-jin* like him here. In its defense, the movie wasn't about witty Japanese people, it was about two Americans feeling alienated from their surroundings and their respective marriages. I think the bar/karaoke scenes were a good show of people being open with each other, getting along, and having fun. All this in spite of cultural differences. And all this thanks (maybe solely) to alcohol.</p>
<p>I don't that this is unfair to Japan.</p>
<p>___<br />
On a tangent, but definitely tangential... I'm not going to live here forever. Maybe <em>Lost in Translation</em> helped me realize this.</p>
