  <p>2004-04-11</p>

  <p>1) Grab the book nearest to you, turn to page 18, find line 4. Write down what it says:<br />
"dynamic of each exercise requires the use of your breath"</p>
<p>2) Stretch your left arm out as far as you can. What do you touch first?<br />
bath robe given to me by my host father four years ago</p>
<p>3) What is the last thing you watched on TV?<br />
animated french movie: Les Triplettes de Belleville</p>
<p>4) WITHOUT LOOKING, guess what the time is.<br />
11:12AM</p>
<p>5) Now look at the clock, what is the actual time?<br />
<!--more-->11:27AM</p>
<p>6) With the exception of the computer, what can you hear<br />
wind whipping around my house, that's it</p>
<p>7) When did you last step outside? what were you doing?<br />
i went up the road to a party at 3:30am, came back at 5:30, decided to be awake at 5 or 5:30 more often</p>
<p>8) Before you came to this website, what did you look at?<br />
this disturbing remix of gwb's wmd joke: http://www.musicforamerica.org/misc/media_files/bushjoke.mov</p>
<p>9) What are you wearing?<br />
B-day suit. Oh! It was my half-birthday yesterday! Which means it still is back home. Heh.</p>
<p>10) Did you dream last night?<br />
I dreamt that I was sitting on a couch <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/hitshandinfan/29422.html?thread=41454#t41454">with James</a>.</p>
<p>11) When did you last laugh?<br />
I laughed at some poor girl at the party that asked me to teach her English. Then I felt bad. It wasn't a "laughing with" kindof party for me. The last time I did some good "laughing with" was Friday night at Tomaya, this awesome house in the hills of Noda that is a restaurant sometimes. Brian, an elementary school teacher at an international school in Bankok, did a blues song about stegosaurus on the drum, and I accompanied on harmonica. Laughing while playing harmonica is funny.</p>
<p>12) What is on the walls of the room you are in?<br />
nothing, but the texture is like very rough sandpaper, and the color is tanish</p>
<p>13) Seen anything weird lately?<br />
a women with her face in her hands in a running parked car</p>
<p>14) Last movie you saw?<br />
Les Triplettes de Belleville (this has def. been movie week after a dry spell: Lost in Translation, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Shallow Hal, Shrek, Bruce Almighty, Showgirls; still have House of Sand and Fog, Saving Private Ryan, and Memento left to watch.)</p>
<p>15) If you became a multi-millionaire overnight, what would you buy first?<br />
ya, a house i guess. maybe in brasstown.</p>
<p>16) Tell me something about you that I don't know.<br />
i used corn starch to thicken a sauce for the first time last night</p>
<p>17) If you could change one thing about the world, regardless of guilt or politics, what would you do?<br />
it would be fun to dissolve the usa, break it up like the monopoly it is into fifty little countries. maybe something like the eu bonding together, but no more than that.</p>
<p>18) Do you like to dance?<br />
yes, but i'm no good at it without a partner... that's a big detraction from japan for me: i haven't found one</p>
<p>19) George Bush:<br />
see above .mov link<br />
in addition, i think he is probably more caught up in the evil machinery around him than evil himself, but perhaps that is na&iuml;ve of me.</p>
<p>20) Imagine your first child is a girl, what do you call her?<br />
michaella (a whim, i haven't given that question much thought)</p>
<p>21) [Same question for a boy]<br />
sony <span style="background-color:white;color:white;">(haha, just kidding)</span></p>
<p>22) Would you ever consider living abroad?<br />
yeah i guessso ;)</p>
