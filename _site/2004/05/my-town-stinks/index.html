  <p>2004-05-12</p>

  <p>But only literally, not figuratively.  See, today is the day for burning mounds and mounds of wet grass, and <em>nobody</em> wants to be left out of that action, so everybody is getting in on it.</p>
<p>It is so green... like the greenness is going to start spilling over any second and cover everything.<br />

I went rafting on Sunday on a whim, some friends' friends' friends chartered a bus to go down South and West to Yamagata prefecture.  The raft guide was a strappy guy with a ponytail that could fool anybody into thinking he was Native American.  Very nice chap.  That was a good time, and I met lots of new folks with which I'll be surfing, skiing, and otherwise playing.  I pity the fool in Iwate (and probably all of Tohoku) that doesn't take advantage of the great outdoors.</p>
<p>At the party at Ali's the night before I think I connected with Doug... I knew when I saw that guy's picture a year ago that he would have something to teach me.  That was cool.<br />

And yesterday <a href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&atid=200001&aid=951215&group_id=1">I convinced Sourceforge.net</a> to host <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/wiggle/">a project that I am working on for 3D visualization of stereoscopic pairs of photos</a>.  I worked on it all day at school today, and got the proof of concept working for left to right, but not near to far.  I think that tomorrow at Nakano will give me time to get near to far done--if so I'll post it.  This is definitely the most complicated computer project that I have yet taken upon myself, so by correlation it's the most nerdy... but it is already nifty, even though it is just a half-broke proof-of-concept... so we'll see where it goes.<br />

Tonight I'm gonna watch Blue Crush.  This morning I got an email that <a href="http://www.oneill.com/surf/index.php?G=M&Cat=surf&type=Full%20Suits%20%28cold%20-%20frigid%29&expand=Heat&prodid=1736">my new wetsuit</a> and <a href="http://www.oneill.com/surf/index.php?G=M&Cat=surf&type=Boots%20%28cold%20-%20frigid%29&expand=heat%20boots&prodid=0678">booties</a> are on the way!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
