  <p><a title="Hero trailer from Quicktime website." href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/miramax/hero/"><img alt="Hero" src="/assets/hero_promo_poster.jpg" style="margin-right:10px;" width="134" height="193" border="0" align="left" /></a>One advantage of living in Japan is that we get Chinese way movies before they come out in the States.  <em>Hero</em> was out last Summer, and even though I couldn't understand most of it it was def. worth seeing.  It's beautiful, and I look forward to understanding the intricacies of the story someday.</p>
<p>Wed & Thu mornings I got up early to get into the water (Friday morning a taifu had blown in, so I chose sleeping in (and, therefore, life)).  I think I like the whole "early to bed, early to rise" thing, and it is a lot easier with the surfing as impetus.  I bought a wetsuit, booties, and prescription surfing sunglasses almost without thinking about it.  I'm looking for a van as well, and hope to find one before all my car taxes are due in October.  I had my mind made up to grow my hair again, but it will be a pain to take care of since I'm gonna be in the ocean all the time...  so my hair is in limbo again.  All of this points down the path to a slippery slope of getting sucked into a particular lifestyle, which makes me chuckle at myself a bit.</p>
<p>This week in my free time at school I learned some JavaScript, which was a pretty direct jump from Flash.  Now I'm getting them to play together for the Wiggle project, which might have a usable version within a few days.  I still havn't wrapped my brain around the geometry for depth focusing, but I havn't lost motivation, so it shall get done.</p>
<p>Thursday I made pizza for the <em>Tofu Expressway Rambling Stringband</em>, and I had some yeast starter left over, so I made pancake batter and stuck it in the fridge.  I made the pancakes Friday morning, and they were so good that I thought about them all day.  Sometimes that feeling is indigestion, but not this time....  No, this time it was obsession.  So yeast-levened pancakes are a winner.<br />

Somebody from my past (Summer of 1999, Ohio) asked if it is weird for me to have so much of my life online.  The answer is yes, and perhaps I would like to have less, but I think it is kind of an addiction.  Maybe not an addiction, but keeping this thing updated def. shifts my perception of the world.  Maybe a good step would be to make all of my entries that are at all personal "friends-only."  But not yet.</p>
