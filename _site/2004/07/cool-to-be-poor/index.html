  <p>2004-07-02</p>

  <p>After surviving Toyko last weekend, this article sums up nicely why it felt so good to get back. <!--more from the wall street journal...-->
<p>---</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/el_danimal/53627/"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/1/53627_62c1956a2e.jpg" align="left" class="picture" /></a>MORIOKA, Japan -- Nothing was going right for the<br />
residents of northern Iwate prefecture. Try as they<br />
might, the people of Iwate seemed stuck in a poor<br />
backwater, with factories closing, shaky state<br />
finances and few prospects.</p>
<p>So, three years ago, Gov. Hiroya Masuda sent out a<br />
bold new message: Just give up.</p>
<p>"We don't make an effort in Iwate," Mr. Masuda<br />
declared in a nationwide ad campaign that has run<br />
annually since 2001. Iwate should build traditional<br />
wooden houses rather than modern buildings, he said.<br />
Instead of striving like the big cities for economic<br />
growth, people should take pride in their forests.</p>
<p>"In Tokyo, people are chased by speed, and life<br />
consists of working, eating and sleeping," says the<br />
52-year-old Mr. Masuda, who has local government<br />
employees print the we-don't make-an-effort slogan on<br />
their business cards. "Here, I want people to go home<br />
early in the evening, take a walk with their family,<br />
and talk to the neighbors."</p>
<p>The wacky ads have been a hit. They boosted Mr.<br />
Masuda's standing in Iwate, helping him get elected<br />
for a third time last year, with 88% of votes cast.<br />
They also struck a chord with Japanese nationwide.<br />
Opposing effort in Japan is as bizarre as disparaging<br />
freedom in America. But since their economy slowed in<br />
the 1990s, many Japanese have started to question<br />
whether their hard work was really worth it.</p>
<p>In the past, even average Japanese workers who devoted<br />
their lives to a corporation could prosper.</p>
<p>"If you graduated from college and worked solidly, you<br />
would reach an annual salary of ¥10 million," about<br />
$90,000, says economist Takuro Morinaga, author of a<br />
shelf of downshifting bestsellers with titles such as<br />
"It's Cool to Be Poor." But now that not everyone gets<br />
rich, "They think, why should they work themselves to<br />
death for their company?" he says.</p>
<p>The same logic applies to regional economies. Poorer<br />
areas used to believe they could catch up with Tokyo<br />
living standards, and the central government helped<br />
with generous handouts. But this aid has been slashed,<br />
and while the urban economies are taking off again,<br />
many provinces remain stalled. Iwate people earn less<br />
than 60% of what people in Tokyo do, and the<br />
prefecture has debts of about $9,000 per citizen.</p>
<p>Far from being derided, the four annual ad campaigns<br />
attracted a total of 23,816 overwhelmingly favorable<br />
e-mails -- mainly from women tired of trying to cope<br />
with the strain of work and family. "Iwate is great<br />
for daring to renounce effort," wrote one 42-year-old<br />
woman. "This really takes a weight off my shoulders."</p>
<p>Actually, the most enthusiastic anti-effort people are<br />
former city-dwellers who have rushed to Iwate to lead<br />
the slow life -- people like the governor himself who<br />
used to work for the national government in Tokyo.</p>
<p>Tetsuya Watanabe, a former publishing company<br />
employee, now grows flowers and vegetables on a<br />
picturesque 2.5-acre farm surrounded by mountains,<br />
woods and rice paddies. Mr. Watanabe, a philosophy<br />
graduate, says "no effort" means living a more<br />
fulfilling life, closer to nature and away from the<br />
economic pressures of the city.</p>
<p>"We don't make an effort in a normal way, but we're<br />
very busy," says the 41-year-old over a lunch of fish,<br />
rice and home-grown vegetables. "It's just not the<br />
kind of busyness where you feel stressed.<br />
Tokyo native Nobuo Yoshinari is spreading the<br />
no-effort message to the younger generation. He used<br />
to work so hard for an event-promotion company that<br />
his wife complained he talked only about business. A<br />
few years ago, he quit and moved to Iwate.</p>
<p>Now 47 years old, he runs the Iwate Children's Forest,<br />
a center that mixes play and learning. Kids study<br />
flowers, cook outdoors and clamber over obstacle<br />
courses. And the center has what Mr. Yoshinari calls a<br />
"no-effort declaration for parents," including the<br />
instruction: "Don't tell your kids to be quick, or<br />
thoughtlessly hurry them up."</p>
<p>Mr. Yoshinari is also building a nature retreat deep<br />
in the Iwate mountains. Urban Japanese use high-tech<br />
electronic toilets, and throw out perfectly good TV<br />
sets.</p>
<p>At the "Forest and Wind School," toilet users sprinkle<br />
wood shavings over waste, which is then applied to the<br />
school's vegetable patch or fermented to produce<br />
"biogas," fuel for the center's cafe.<br />
Such projects have turned Iwate into a mecca for<br />
Japan's nascent slow-life movement. Small towns are<br />
promoting green tourism, where urban visitors come to<br />
work on a farm, search the mountains for wild<br />
vegetables, and make traditional paper. Iwate's<br />
standout industrial complex? Japan's biggest wind<br />
farm.</p>
<p>Traditionalists think this has all gone too far.<br />
Toshio Sasaki, a 73-year-old local assemblyman who<br />
used to run a fishing business, says he has been<br />
striving to drag local living standards closer to<br />
those of Tokyo. Mr. Sasaki says it is crazy to waste<br />
nearly $400,000 each year on ads that make the<br />
prefecture appear lazy. He says Iwate, with its harsh<br />
winters, rugged mountains and struggling fishing<br />
villages, was built on effort -- and needs plenty more<br />
in the future. Protesting the no-effort campaign in<br />
November 2002, he told the Iwate Prefecture Assembly:<br />
"Our elders were like oxen, who said nothing but made<br />
an effort."</p>
<p>What really bugs him is urbanites who patronize the<br />
region as a quaint backwater. "One woman wrote the<br />
prefecture to say she was trying hard to raise her<br />
children and wanted Iwate's nature to be preserved so<br />
she could eventually come here to relax. I thought,<br />
'What about us in Iwate? Are we supposed just to<br />
remain backward for the sake of these people from<br />
Tokyo?' "</p>
<p>The counterattack widened in June when Iwate<br />
management consultant Ken Miya gave a speech at a<br />
conference in Morioka, the prefecture capital, titled,<br />
"Let's Make an Effort, Iwate!" His small-business<br />
clients would collapse if they didn't make an effort,<br />
he told 100 local officials and businessmen. He wanted<br />
Mr. Masuda to make an effort to pay off Iwate's public<br />
debt, which recently triggered a 4% pay cut for public<br />
employees. But instead, "the governor is sweating and<br />
making an effort to explain the no-effort<br />
declaration," he said. "Hasn't he got anything better<br />
to do?"</p>
<p>But many locals back Mr. Masuda. Hiroko Fujisawa, a<br />
34-year-old baker, says that people were long used to<br />
the slow life in Iwate but the governor helped them<br />
see this as good. "Masuda gives us hope for the<br />
future," she says.</p>
<p>Mr. Masuda says that instead of just goofing off, the<br />
"no effort" is about rethinking values. He thinks the<br />
no-effort campaign has given locals confidence in the<br />
things they have -- pleasant scenery, traditional<br />
pottery and natural foods -- so they focus less on the<br />
things they lack.</p>
<p>"There is more pride in the region and its culture and<br />
history," he says. "Young people's thinking will<br />
change, and they will stop yearning for Tokyo."<br />
As for going slow, Gov. Masuda doesn't always heed his<br />
own advice. He gets up at 6 a.m. and starts work at<br />
7:30. He works in the prefecture office until 6 or 7<br />
in the evening. He also works Saturdays and Sundays,<br />
and says: "I don't have so much free time."</p>

<p>Edit: <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/forrestino/116719.html?thread=90863#t90863">Sharon replies</a> to the article on BigDaikon on the ensuing hilarity. Apparently, Iwate prefectural government is all worked up about this, because now the world thinks we are lazy. I say follow Masuda-san's advice: chill out! (Ya lazy bums.)</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p>
