  <p>2004-03-12</p>

  <p>I was stuck at my desk with absolutely no responsibilities... 8:30 to 5:15, with an hour off for lunch.  Lunch was good, I made a quick veggie stew, but I was talking to a friend back home and hearing stuff that I had expected to hear, but it still stung a little.  At least when I have nothing to do at school I can wander around, visit classes, practice piano.  At the office I am stuck.  I went to Google News with a feeling that something bad/big had happened in the world, and found out about Madrid.  3/11, sheeze... 2.5 years to the day.  Clicking around I read quotes like this<br />
<blockquote>Decir que "no hay palabras" es un tópico tan usado que ha perdido su significado. Pero es que, literalmente, hoy no encuentro en el diccionario nada con lo que nombrar a esta masacre.</p></blockquote>
<p> from <a href="http://www.escolar.net/MT/archives/000622.html">Escolar.net</a> which provoked an unexpected response from me emotionally... It actually made me want to pack up my stuff and get out of Japan.  Why?  B/c I can read that.  I can understand that.  If those words/emotions were in Japanese I would be completely lost.  So yeah, I'm feeling helpless about the freaking language yet again.  I don't know any foreigners that communicate on that level.  It's not just the language barrior; there are cultural issues as well.  But the language, ah!  Talk about being at a seemingly insurmountable plateau.  I can't communicate at that level in Japanese, so I can't make meaningful conversation here, so my friendships are all shallow.  Whatever level I'm at now with Japanese, I could get there in a few months if I were in Latin America (and then learn more!).  So I want to to get back to Spanish now, after all these years.</p>
<p>These emotions can and will probably dissolve in a couple of days.  Dissolve to what, though?  Is my choice depression or numbness? I don't even want to post this now.</p>
