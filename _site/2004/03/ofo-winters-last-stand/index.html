  <p>2004-03-05</p>

  <p>Hey everybody!</p>
<p>The average day’s weather this week has been sunny and blue in the<br />
morning, dumping snow in the afternoon, dramatic colorful cloudy sunsets,<br />
and clear, freezing nights.</p>
<p>Everybody complains about how cold it is here. Japan is one of the most<br />
technically advanced places on earth, the line goes, yet they still have<br />
not figured out insulation and central heating. This much is true--most<br />
houses and schools don’t have either. My house is blessed with two vented<br />
kerosene heaters, one in the living room and one upstairs in the bedroom.<br />
The “vented” part is a relatively new key innovation; otherwise I would have to crack a<br />
window to keep from dying.</p>
<p>I have gotten used to the system, though, and may have even grown to like it.</p>
<p>I was thinking back to the Great Carrboro power outage of 2001, and how it<br />
was 46 degrees Fahrenheit in my house and I thought I would freeze to<br />
death. Now it is usually a little more or less than 32F, and I am<br />
completely used to it. I sleep with two down comforters, and have the<br />
heater timed to heat up my room 30 minutes before I wake. On average, I<br />
end up burning just enough fuel to heat one room to 60F (that feels balmy<br />
now) for two or three hours. I bought three cans of kerosene back when it<br />
started to get cold, and just finished the second. That is about $16 for<br />
three cold months... not bad. There is something nice about knowing<br />
exactly how much I am impacting the world for warmth.</p>
<p>On another note, the school year is coming to an end. Soon I’ll get to go<br />
to a bunch of middle-school graduations and see those kids off into the<br />
world. Yeah, I’ll miss them--even Kadonohama’s graduates, the little<br />
boogers. All of the students have been working on reviewing for year-end<br />
tests, which means that I have had a lot of downtime (even more than<br />
usual). I’ve been using that time working on a pet project that has been<br />
on the back burner for about a year now:</p>
<p><a href="http://folktunes.org/">http://folktunes.org/</a> - The Folktunes Archive</p>
<p>The Folktunes Archive will be a collection of all kinds of folk tunes that<br />
anybody will be able to stream or download to learn. Anybody will be able<br />
to add to the collection as well. I’m currently seeking advise for this<br />
project, so if you have any, give me a call or email.</p>
<p>I’ve redesigned the homepage, but I don’t think it is quite right yet...<br />
any ideas? I’ve also got the structure in place to start archiving<br />
recordings. I want the first ten recordings in the archive to be ten<br />
different people playing the first song that they ever learned. Please<br />
drop me a line if you can help.</p>
