<p>The challenge was to programmatically draw a Fibonacci spiral.  In high school I had tried on a TI-8x calculator after getting it to display the numerical sequence in a loop, but gave up the challenge until diving into ActionScript.</p>

<h3>Directions</h3>
<p>Click the top-right button to add a square.  Each time you click it represents n+1 in the sequence: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, etc...</p>

<div id="flash">Got Flash?</div>

<p>Eventually, it breaks.  Before then, you can use Flash's "zoom in" feature to zoom into the spiral you have created.  Click the top-left button to reset.</p>
