<p>We here at Forresto Industries know what a hassle it is for you to constantly 
control the media output of the major news networks. Granted, consolidation of 
the media giants has simplified matters somewhat, but what if somebody in 
mainstream media gets unruly and decides that the truth might sell? What if 
independent media providers become popular? Then what will you do?

<p><font size="+1">We have the solution.</font>

<p>Jam the airwaves with this: code name MBX-01A, long name Forresto Industries' 
Mediabitch, short name Mediabitch is a media-control dream come true. As 
independent contractors we are offering to licence this technology to the DOD 
for a low $10,000 per instance usage fee. "Skins" will be developed such as 
politicians and celebrity newscasters to replace to default "Talking Head" 
prototype. Speaking of which, <font size="+2"><a href="mediabitch.html">on to the prototype!</a></font>

<p>Hegemonicaly,
<br>Forresto Industries Media Devision
