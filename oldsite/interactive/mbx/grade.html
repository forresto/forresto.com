<p>Project A course A- Really nice finish. Beautiful project. Your 
work throughout the course has been very solid and I appreciate that and 
your effort.. There is a really nice "pop" quality buried in your work 
that I think will help when you are marketing wares.
You seem intent upon revealing a one line of commentary or the one line 
joke that tags or provides some coda reference I am not always certain 
of this mediative gesture. That is, I appreciate the depth of 
information you hide or protect with the that "one line" but as an 
audience member I begin to doubt the force/impact of your work because 
of the cheapening effect such a single reference tends to make. I truly 
appreciated your ability to cleverly and creatively solve the problems 
placed before you, interpreting suggestions and creating work that was 
very much your own. That individuality is coupled with an ability to 
package that work in a way that suits others in your audience.
Great Job! Congratulations on finishing!

<p>Thanks
