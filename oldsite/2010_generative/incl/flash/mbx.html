<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Dear DOD,</p>
<p>We here at Forresto Industries know what a hassle it is for you to constantly control the media output of the major news networks. Granted, consolidation of the media giants has simplified matters somewhat, but what if somebody in mainstream media gets unruly and decides that the truth might sell? What if independent media providers become popular? Then what will you do?</p>
<p>We have the solution.</p>
<p>Jam the airwaves with this: code name MBX-01A, long name Forresto Industries' M1d1abix, short name M1d1abix is a media-control dream come true. As independent contractors we are offering to licence this technology to the DOD for a low $10,000 per instance usage fee. "Skins" will be developed such as politicians and celebrity newscasters to replace to default "Talking Head" prototype. Speaking of which, on to the prototype!</p>
