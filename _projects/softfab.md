Web-based tool for making clothing patterns that change with body measurements.

This is a unique method to solve this challenge, using Verlet physics to alter the shapes with the measurement constraints. Graphics are rendered with SVG.

This is a passion project with my partner, whose studio is [friendsday.fi](http://friendsday.fi/)
