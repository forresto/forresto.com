My goal for this CAD Comparison week should be to get a very rough model from each system that I try. As possible, it should have ballpark dimensions and features, but only get to the level of rough sketch.

"Prompt" for myself, any tutors that I have time with, and any LLMs that I experiment with.

* hexagon shaped box
* 100mm diameter
* extrude to 40mm height
* top has inset hexagon with 80mm diameter and 10mm depth
* two opposing edges have place for fingers subtracted, pills or spheres with 20mm diameter
