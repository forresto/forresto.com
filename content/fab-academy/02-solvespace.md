Kris introduced [SolveSpace](https://solvespace.com/) on Friday, and it started to click today after tinkering for a while.

This video shows the sketches, groups, and constraints that build up my part.

# Constraint-based design

Using SolveSpace feels like a kind of geometry game, where you sketch a shape, then add constraints until the degrees of freedom goes to 0 (`dof ok`) and the part is fully constrained. But look out, because if you add too many you'll end up with redundant constraints.

The first challenge with my design was to make a hexagon. I tried a few ways to construct this, but later saw a tutorial with a straightforward way.

1. Sketch circle (shortcut "c")
    * `dof 1` (meaning you can change the diameter)
    * Give the circle a diameter ("d")
    * `dof ok` (fully constrained)
2. Select circle and make it a construction reference ("g")
    * It turns green
3. Draw a chain of 6 segments around the circle ("s" for each segment)
    * `dof 6` (you can drag the ends around the circle)
4. Select pairs of segments and give them equal length constraints ("q")
    * According to the tutorial video, a future version will allow selecting all of the segments and making them equal at once. This doesn't work with my current version. ðŸ‘ˆ
    * `dof 1` (you can rotate the hexagon around the circle.)
5. Select a point of the hexagon and the X axis, add "point on plane" constraint ("o"), `dof ok`

Now the drawing is fully constrained, and you can change the diameter measurement to change the diameter of the hexagon.

# Questions

* Is there a way to name specific distance constraints and view them in a list?
* Why isn't there a built-in polygon definition? (Even [picoCAD](02-picocad.md) has hex. prism as a built-in shape. ðŸ˜…)
* Is there a way to define one's own reusable sketches or parts?
* Why are redundant constraints treated as an error?

# Conclusion

I appreciate that SolveSpace.app is small, 29 MB on my machine. It starts and runs fast. I like the minimal vector aesthetic, and the general feel of the app. I can imagine it being useful to design quick, exact parts.

It doesn't seem to bridge the gap from constraint-based to parametric modeling. It seems like I've done all the work to make a parametric model, but have to dive through the layers to change any of the dimensions. It would be helpful to expose some of the dimensions as parameters. That would be a step towards making a library of reusable parts.

By getting a feel for different CAD software I'm starting to understand different ways of thinking about geometry. I've been working on [Cuttle](https://cuttle.xyz) for 4 years now, and design in that app is limited to the parametric 2d methods that we made it for. Learning other apps is mind-expanding, like parallel universes.
